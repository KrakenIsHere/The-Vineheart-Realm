# Sacred Priestesses
At the heart of each continent's [[Wound Containment|ritual]] stands a Godwound Priestess - women chosen from birth and trained to become living repositories of ancient knowledge. These priestesses are both guides and catalysts, their very beings attuned to [[The Godwound]].

## The Priestesses
### The Memberian Priestess
#### The Frost Speaker
- Wears ceremonial armor made from eternal ice
- Maintains the longest lifespan of all priestesses due to the preserving cold

### The Luminian Priestess
#### The Wind Whisperer
- Their voice carries power over the air itself
- Traditionally remains unmarried, wedded to the sky
- Often develops the ability to levitate (not fly)

### The Onyxian Priestess
#### The Flame Guardian
- Bears special resistance to extreme heat
- Shortest average lifespan due to the intensity of their powers
- Can communicate through flames with other fire temples

### The Arcanian Priestess
#### The Tide Singer
- Their tears have powerful purifying properties
- Communicates with sea creatures


## Selection and Training
- Potential priestesses show signs at birth (birthmarks, unusual red eyes, and high magical sensitivity)
- Only one can serve at a time for each continent
- Training begins as early as at age seven and continues until ascension
- Multiple candidates are trained, but only one can be chosen
- The training process involves both scholarly study and magical attunement
In the event that a candidate cannot be 


## The Priestess's Role
- Acts as a living conduit between [[The Godwound]] and the ritual
- Carries the complete knowledge of ritual procedures in their memory
- Can sense disturbances in [[The Godwound]]'s energy
- Their blood contains properties necessary for certain ritual components
- Maintains mental connections with other continental priestesses


## The Burden of Knowledge
- Each priestess carries the ritual knowledge of their region
- They are forbidden from sharing certain secrets except with their successor
- Their dreams are often prophetic, showing potential futures
- The role takes a physical toll, often shortening their lifespan


## Succession
- Current priestesses help identify their potential successors
- The transfer of knowledge occurs through a mystical ceremony
- If a priestess dies before passing on their knowledge, emergency measures exist
	Each member of [[The Godwounded#The Inner Circle|The Echo Chamber]] holds portions of the full [[Wound Containment|ritual]] 
- Failed transfers have led to lost knowledge and ritual adaptations


## The Priestesses' Council
- Meets once a year before the rituals
- Shares vital information about [[The Godwound]]'s state
- Coordinates ritual timing and preparations
- Makes decisions about sharing or withholding knowledge


## Political Implications
- All branches & Priestesses must remain politically neutral
- Some nations try to influence priestess selection
- Protection of priestesses can be used as political leverage
- Assassination (& kidnapping) attempts have occurred in the past
- Marriage proposals to priestesses often cause diplomatic incidents
