# The Dawn of The New Age
After the calamity that was the **The Devine War**, by the **Dawn of The New Age**, came **The Vineheart Realm** named after the hero party who kept damages and casualties to a minimum during the war.

## The Vineheart Realm
In the chaos of [[The Devine War]], when gods themselves threatened to tear the world asunder, a group of heroes emerged who would shape the course of history. **The Vineheart Party**, as they came to be known, worked tirelessly to protect mortal settlements, evacuate civilians from divine battlegrounds, and minimize the catastrophic impact of godly conflicts. Their actions saved countless lives and preserved bastions of civilization that would have otherwise been lost.

### Formation of the Realm
In recognition of their heroic deeds, the surviving powers and peoples united under the banner of these heroes, establishing the Vineheart Realm. This marked the beginning of a new era of mortal self-determination, where people looked not just to the gods but to their own strength and unity for survival.

### Early Developments
The first decades of the Vineheart Realm were characterized by:
- Creation of emergency response protocols based on the Vineheart Party's methods
- Establishment of sanctuaries in areas protected during the war
- Development of new magical techniques for containing divine residue
- Formation of a unified system of governance inspired by the heroes' principles
- Creation of the Vineheart Chronicles, documenting both the war and the realm's founding

### Societal Changes
The Vineheart Realm brought significant changes to how society functioned:
- Emphasis on mortal cooperation over divine intervention
- Integration of divine worship with practical governance
- New forms of magic focusing on protection and restoration
- Development of communication networks between settlements
- Establishment of the Vineheart Rangers, protectors of travel routes

### Legacy of the Heroes
The Vineheart Party's influence extended far beyond their immediate actions:
- Their methods of crisis management became standard practice
- Their stories inspired a new generation of adventurers and leaders
- Their principles of unity across racial and cultural lines shaped policy
- Their techniques for dealing with divine power were preserved and taught
- Their names became synonymous with hope and resilience

### Foundations for Recovery
This period laid the groundwork for civilization's gradual recovery:
- Establishment of trade routes between surviving settlements
- Creation of magical academies focused on practical rather than divine magic
- Development of new farming techniques for magically altered lands
- Formation of diplomatic protocols between emerging nations
- Preservation of knowledge and culture from before the war

The Dawn of The New Age, through the formation of the Vineheart Realm, represented more than just recovery from devastation - it marked a fundamental shift in how mortals viewed themselves and their relationship with the divine. The heroes who inspired this realm proved that even in the face of godly conflict, mortal courage and unity could prevail.

### The Godwound

### Calendar
- The realm has since reset their time keeping to be in line for the new age.
	This was partially done since the last method for keeping time was unreliable.
- As the oldest texts found after the war were around 100 years old.
	It was determined to start the new age at the year 100.
	There has since been found what is thought to be older texts.

## The divided land
After **The Devine War** the Godwound ripped the continent into several pieces.
The landmass that was once whole, had become 4 continents and several islands

## Four Centuries Later
The Sundering of Lands. When [[The Godwound]] first manifested, its power didn't just tear the fabric of realityâ€”it physically ripped the continent apart. The once-unified landmass known as **Magnica** was split into four distinct continents, separated by great waters born from divine chaos. Each being named after the closest surviving royal family of their respective areas.

### The Waters
- The Godwound's energy created the Sundering Seas
- New island chains formed from fragments of the original continent
- Some islands hold powerful concentrations of divine energy
- Maritime trade routes have become crucial for inter-continental commerce

### Modern Political Landscape
The Sundering brought an end to ancient territorial disputes but gave rise to new forms of conflict:
- Naval supremacy became the new measure of power
- Trade routes and island control drive modern politics
- Each continent developed distinct cultural identities
- Inter-continental alliances are both vital and fragile

### Technological and Magical Evolution
The post-Sundering world saw unique developments:
- Navigation magic evolved to cope with the Godwound's interference
- New forms of communication developed to bridge the continental divide
- Each region developed specialized magic based on their environment
- Trade in unique regional resources drives innovation

### Cultural Transformation
Four centuries of separation have led to:
- Distinct regional interpretations of the old gods
- New traditions born from adaptation to changed environments
- Unique architectural styles influenced by local conditions
- Regional variations in magical practices and beliefs

### Modern Challenges
Despite centuries of recovery, the world faces ongoing issues:
- Periodic expansions of the Godwound require constant vigilance
- Pirates exploit the dangerous waters between continents
- Religious conflicts persist over interpretations of divine intent
- Resource competition drives inter-continental tensions
- Some dream of reunification while others defend independence

### Legacy of Division
The Sundering, while catastrophic, brought some unexpected benefits:
- Clearer borders reduced traditional territorial warfare
- Diverse environments promoted cultural and technological specialization
- Separated populations developed unique solutions to shared problems
- New forms of cooperation emerged between distant lands

The world may be physically divided, but the challenges of the Dawn of The New Age have created connections that span the Sundering Seas, proving that even in separation, the peoples of these lands find ways to reach across the raging divide.
