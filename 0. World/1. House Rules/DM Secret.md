## Wishes

### Divine Sources:

- Gods can grant wishes, typically to devoted followers or as rewards for completing important quests. These wishes tend to be more reliable and less likely to have negative consequences, especially if aligned with the deity's domain and values.
- Solar angels, being direct servants of gods, can cast the Wish spell and may grant wishes to mortals who serve divine purposes.

### Magical Items:

- Ring of Three Wishes is the most straightforward source, containing exactly three wishes
- Luck Blade contains 1-4 wishes
- Efreeti Bottles can grant three wishes, but the Efreeti will try to twist the wording
- Well of Many Worlds might occasionally grant wish-like effects

### Powerful Beings:

- Genies (particularly Efreet) are famous wish-granters, but are notorious for twisting wishes
- Ancient dragons, especially gold and red dragons, might grant wishes as rewards or bargaining chips
- Archfey might grant wish-like effects through powerful fey magic, though these often come with strings attached
- Demon Lords and Archdevils can grant wish-like effects, but these are extremely dangerous to accept

Regarding types of wishes they'll perform:

Most entities can replicate any spell of 8th level or lower perfectly. Beyond that, common applications include:

- Healing all creatures
- Reviving the dead (though with potential limitations)
- Creating valuable items (up to 25,000 gp)
- Granting resistance to damage types
- Undoing recent events

However, more powerful wishes like changing the past, killing powerful beings, or granting permanent stat increases often have limitations or consequences. The more powerful the wish, the more likely it is to be twisted or have unintended side effects.

The entity granting the wish greatly influences how it's interpreted:

- [[DM Secret#Gods|Gods]] tend to grant wishes fairly but within their domain
- [[DM Secret#Devils & Demons|Devils & Demons]] interpret wishes literally and maliciously
- [[DM Secret#Genies|Genies]] look for loopholes to exploit
- Magic items like the Ring of Three Wishes tend to be more straightforward
- [[DM Secret#Fey|Fey]] might add whimsical or chaotic elements to the wish's fulfillment

##### Init Prompt
In my DnD homebrew game I have a Genie and I need help to make sure that my player's wishes (look for loopholes to exploit) have a really bad twist, I'll give you the wishes later.

## PvP Scenarios

If a PvP scenario is determined the DM shall give the player(s) affected, a temporary & limited taste of the godhood the DM possess.

### Divine Victim's Right

When a player betrays the sacred bonds of fellowship by raising arms against their companion, the gods take notice. The wronged soul is temporarily blessed with a fragment of divine authority - a sacred gift meant to restore balance and remind all that treachery carries consequences.

This blessing is not granted lightly, nor is it a tool for revenge. It represents the gods' intervention to protect those wrongfully attacked by their trusted allies. Those who receive this blessing often report feeling a warm golden light flowing through them, accompanied by a sense of righteous purpose.

However, wielding even a fraction of divine power requires great responsibility. The blessed must show restraint and wisdom, using these gifts only to defend themselves and restore peace. Abuse of this divine trust or attempting to extend vengeance beyond self-defense will result in the immediate withdrawal of these powers.

Let this serve as a reminder: The bonds between adventurers are sacred, and those who break them face not just mortal consequences, but divine judgment.

## Custom Effects

### Plot Armor
*A mystical protection that bends fate itself*

**Duration:** Permanent
**Type:** Story Effect

Useful effect
1. "Teleportation"
	Happens to appear in locations it makes no sense for them to be.
2. Survives ridiculous events
	Falls
	Traps

When a character with Plot Armor would die from any effect, they instead:
1. Drop to 1 HP
2. Gain temporary immunity to all damage until the start of their next turn
3. Mark one use of Plot Armor
4. Roll on the Dramatic Consequence table

The effect can be used X times. After all uses are expended, the character becomes vulnerable to death as normal.

#### Narrative Description
Your very existence seems to defy fate. Death itself appears reluctant to claim you, as if you have some greater purpose yet unfulfilled. While others might perish from a fatal blow, you find yourself barely clinging to life, saved by improbable circumstances.


#### Dramatic Consequences (roll 1d6)
1. **Lasting Scar** - Disadvantage on Charisma checks for **1d4** days
2. **Haunting Visions** - Disadvantage on Wisdom saves for **1d4** days
3. **Weakened Spirit** - Maximum HP reduced by 10 until next long rest
4. **Death's Mark** - Healing received is halved for **1d4** days
5. **Fate's Debt** - Next death saving throw is made with disadvantage
6. **Soul Drain** - Lose one unused Hit Die

#### Notes
- Track uses discretely
- Consider incorporating near-death experiences into character development
- Can be restored during major story beats if dramatically appropriate
