# Rest:

## Types:

### Short rest:
- can be taken 2 times every day and consumes 1 Hour of said day

### Long Rest:
- Can be taken at any point of the day and consumes 8 Hours of said day
- Provides FULL recovery
> [!Note] Long Rest Conditions
> - 1 Short rest must have been used before a long rest can be initiated 
> 	- Unless 16 hours or more have passed since the last long rest

### Partial Long Rest:
- Can be taken at any point of the day and consumes 4 Hours
- Half of a character’s missing spell slots will be restored
- Healing goes up to 50% of a character’s HP
>[!Note] Partial Long Rest Conditions
>- 1 Short rest must have been used before a partial long rest can be initiated
>- Unless 16 hours or more have passed since the last Partial Long Rest or Long Rest

### Interrupted Rest:
- can happen in the event of an ambush or other unexpected visitors during a long rest.
- Depending on the event, statuses can be applied (Such as Poorly Rested)
- Depending on the event the DM must decide:
	If the rest concludes after the event or if the rest is continued.
- If the rest concludes a partial rest is assumed but not certain

> [!Note] Times for chance based events
> **Day event:** 1d20 roll higher than a 3d12 roll
> - (8.45% Chance)
>
> **Night event:** 1d20 roll higher than a 2d12 roll
> - (27.08% Chance)

## Rest Conditions:
If a rest passes into a new day a status of “Well Rested” may apply based on a counter roll with a **1d10** by the player for the DM’s roll of a **1d12**
> [!Warning] Sleep amount
> Too little or too much sleep can result in the “Poorly Rested” status

### Keeping watch:
During a Long Rest, party members can “keep watch” The members keeping said watch will only get a partial long rest. In the event of an interrupted rest, the members keeping watch will not have the status “surprised” applied, and will be ready for potential combat.

A rotation can be applied, resulting in all members only getting a partial long rest while passing the full 8 hours

### Catchup:
An individual short rest can be taken during travel, provided conditions allow.
> [!Note] Effect
> This has the chance to remove the **Poorly rested** status **1d20** _(Roll against DM's 1d10)_

#### Meditation
Meditation can refill HP & Spell slots, depending on conditions & duration.

Instead of a short rest, meditation can be utilized at any point, at points where conditions allow.
> [!Note] Effect
> This has the chance to remove the **Poorly rested** status **1d20** with advantage _(Roll against DM's 1d20)_

# Characters:
Generally changed from [[DnD 5e Players Handbook (BnW OCR).pdf#page=8|5e]]

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a powerful tool that represents moments when characters rise above their normal capabilities, drawing upon inner reserves of heroism, willpower, or dramatic flair. This expanded system transforms inspiration from a simple binary state into a dynamic resource that grows with character development and meaningful role-playing.

### Earning Inspiration

Characters can earn inspiration points in several ways:

#### Role-Playing Excellence

- **Character Values**: Acting according to your character's beliefs, flaws, bonds, or ideals, especially when doing so creates complications.
- **Memorable Moments**: Creating standout moments through vivid descriptions, emotional depth, or creative problem-solving.
- **Character Growth**: Demonstrating significant character development or confronting personal demons.

#### Game Contributions

- **Recap Bonus**: A player who volunteers to recap the previous session can earn 1 inspiration point.
- **Group Support**: Helping another player shine or supporting the table dynamics in a positive way.
- **Creative Solutions**: Devising approaches to challenges that surprise and entertain the table.

#### Milestone Achievements

- **Personal Quest Progress**: Advancing a character's personal storyline.
- **Critical Discoveries**: Uncovering vital information that propels the campaign forward.
- **Heroic Sacrifices**: Taking significant risks for the good of the party or NPCs.

### Capacity

Unlike the standard rules where inspiration is simply held or not held, this system allows accumulation:

| Character Level | Maximum Inspiration Points |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1-4             | 1 points                   |
| 5-10            | 2 points                   |
| 11-16           | 3 points                   |
| 17-20           | 5 points                   |

### Usage

Inspiration points can be spent in various ways, with more powerful effects requiring more points:

#### Basic Uses (1 Point)

- **Advantage**: Gain advantage on any d20 roll.
- **Assist Ally**: Grant advantage to another player's roll.
- **Flashback**: Establish a minor previously unmentioned preparation or connection.
- **Second Wind**: Regain hit points equal to your level + Constitution modifier (once per short rest).

#### Advanced Uses (2 Points)

- **Decisive Moment**: Add your proficiency bonus to any d20 roll after seeing the result.
- **Narrative Control**: Introduce a minor environmental detail or NPC connection that aids the current situation.
- **Resilience**: Automatically succeed on a saving throw to maintain concentration.
- **Heroic Effort**: Take an additional bonus action on your turn.

#### Heroic Uses (3 Points)

- **Turning Point**: Turn a failure into a success on any d20 roll.
- **Critical Moment**: Convert a hit into a critical hit.
- **Defiance**: Ignore the effects of one condition until the end of your next turn.
- **Inspiration Surge**: Immediately regain and use a spent feature, spell slot of 3rd level or lower, or class resource.

#### Legendary Acts (All Inspiration Points)

- **Fate's Hand**: Automatically succeed on a death saving throw and regain 1 hit point.
- **Heroic Intervention**: Take a full turn out of initiative order.
- **Miraculous Escape**: Avoid all damage and effects from one attack or event that would reduce you to 0 hit points.
- **Narrative Twist**: Work with the DM to introduce a significant plot development or unexpected aid in a dire situation.

### Decay

To encourage the use of inspiration:
- At the end of each session, characters lose their accumulated inspiration points.

### Tracking

Players track inspiration points on their character sheets. The DM may provide physical tokens (coins, glass beads, etc.) to represent inspiration points for a tactile reminder of this resource.

>[!NOTE] DM Note:
>_Remember that inspiration is meant to reward and encourage the kind of play that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone._

## Actions:
- Mounting another character is an action.
- Having your action ready at the beginning of the turn can add a +1 modifier a roll

### PvP
Should an action, result in a fellow player taking damage, the DM will determine whether said damage will trigger a [[DM Custom Rules#PvP Scenarios|PvP]] scenario.

## Stats:
- Individual stats simply represent their modifier, and holds no specific traits
> [!Summary] Delegation of stat points:

# Status Effects

## Cosmic Awareness
(Level 17 Handicap)

As your character's power approaches divine thresholds, they begin perceiving fragments of cosmic truth beyond mortal comprehension. This awareness manifests as:

> [!WARNING] **Otherworldly Visions**:
> At the start of a long rest, roll **1d20**.
> On 1-5, you're plagued by disturbing visions of cosmic truths.
> You gain no benefits from that long rest and start the day [[Gameplay Changes#Poorly Rested|Poorly Rested]].

> [!INFO] **Reality Distortion**:
> Your growing power warps reality around you.
> Small objects occasionally levitate, shadows move incorrectly, and your voice sometimes echoes unnaturally.
> NPCs with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 15 or higher feel instinctively unsettled in your presence, imposing disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with them.

> [!WARNING] **Attraction of the Wound**:
> Your power acts as a beacon to entities beyond the veil.
> Once per week, the DM can have a random cosmic horror creature become aware of you and potentially seek you out.

> [!NOTE] **Knowledge Burden**:
> You occasionally receive unbidden insights into cosmic truths.
> Whenever you roll a natural 20 on an Intelligence check, you might also learn something you were never meant to know.
> The DM may provide a disturbing revelation that offers useful information but might require a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened for 1 minute.
