[[D.M.G. Chapter 8|Bastions]] were introduced in the 2024 version of DnD 

## Acquisition 
- A character can acquire a bastion upon reaching level 7
- A bastion must be either bought or rewarded.
	- It cannot be inherited (Unless it is to another character)
- A bastion can be co-owned between characters

### Purchase
A bastion can only be sold by a royal overseer
- These buildings can vary heavily in price.
	- They can be bought in several [[Bastions Changes#States|states]] of functionality
	- The worse a bastion is the cheaper they get
	- The better a bastion is the cheaper they are to rebuild

### Reward
A bastion can be rewarded by Royalty
- This typically means it is already semi functional
	- It is not guaranteed

A bastion can also be granted by a local head of an area.
- This means the structure is heavily falling apart or is near total ruin

### Combining Bastions
Bastions cannot be combined with pre-existing bastions
In order to co-own bastions as 2 characters the "Combination" goes towards the purchase of more land to then build an extension of what already exists.


## Bastion Turns

The DM can help in the actual drawing of the map if so desired.
