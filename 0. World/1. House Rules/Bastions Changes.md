[[D.M.G. Chapter 8|Bastions]] were introduced in the 2024 version of DnD 

## Acquisition 
- A character can acquire a bastion upon reaching level 6
- A bastion must be either bought or rewarded.
	- It cannot be inherited (Unless it is to another character)
- A bastion can be co-owned between characters

### Purchase
A bastion can only be sold by a royal overseer
- These buildings can vary heavily in price.
	- They can be bought in several [[Bastions Changes#States|states]] of functionality
	- The worse a bastion is the cheaper they get
	- The better a bastion is the cheaper they are to rebuild

### Reward
A bastion can be rewarded by Royalty
- This typically means it is already semi functional
	- It is not guaranteed

A bastion can also be granted by a local head of an area.
- This means the structure is heavily falling apart or is near total ruin

## Layout
It is for the player to draw out the layout of the building after getting specifications from the DM.

The DM can help in the actual drawing of the map if so desired
