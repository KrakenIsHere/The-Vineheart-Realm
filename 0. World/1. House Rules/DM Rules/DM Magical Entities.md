## Wishes

### Divine Sources:

- **Gods** can grant wishes, typically to devoted followers or as rewards for completing important quests. These wishes tend to be more reliable and less likely to have negative consequences, especially if aligned with the deity's domain and values.
- **Solar angels**, being direct servants of gods, can cast the Wish spell and may grant wishes to mortals who serve divine purposes.

### Magical Items:

- Ring of Three Wishes is the most straightforward source, containing exactly three wishes
- Luck Blade contains 1-4 wishes
- **Efreeti** Bottles can grant three wishes, but the **Efreeti** will try to twist the wording
- Well of Many Worlds might occasionally grant wish-like effects

### Powerful Beings:

- **Genies** (particularly Efreet) are famous wish-granters, but are notorious for twisting wishes
- **Ancient dragons**, especially gold and red dragons, might grant wishes as rewards or bargaining chips
- **Archfey** might grant wish-like effects through powerful fey magic, though these often come with strings attached
- **Demon Lords** and **Archdevils** can grant wish-like effects, but these are extremely dangerous to accept

> [!NOTE] Regarding types of wishes they'll perform:
> Most entities can replicate any spell of 8th level or lower perfectly. Beyond that, common applications include:
> - Healing all creatures
> - Reviving the dead (though with potential limitations)
> - Creating valuable items (up to 25,000 GP)
> - Granting resistance to damage types
> - Undoing recent events

However, more powerful wishes like changing the past, killing powerful beings, or granting permanent stat increases often have limitations or consequences. The more powerful the wish, the more likely it is to be twisted or have unintended side effects.

The entity granting the wish greatly influences how it's interpreted:

- [[DM Custom Rules#Gods|Gods]] tend to grant wishes fairly but within their domain
- [[DM Custom Rules#Devils & Demons|Devils & Demons]] interpret wishes literally and maliciously
- [[DM Custom Rules#Genies|Genies]] look for loopholes to exploit
- Magic items like the Ring of Three Wishes tend to be more straightforward
- [[DM Custom Rules#Fey|Fey]] might add whimsical or chaotic elements to the wish's fulfillment
