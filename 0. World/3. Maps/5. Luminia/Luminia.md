## History
Luminia takes its name from the eternal aurora that dances in its skies, a phenomenon said to be a blessing from the gods themselves. Connected to Onyxia through the Obsidian Gate and to Memberia via the Scholar's Bridge.

### Royalty
The royal house of **Dawnweaver** rules Luminia, having maintained their position through [[The Devine War]] by harnessing the continent's unique celestial energies.

#### The House of Dawnweaver
The Dawnweavers are unique among the continental rulers for their claim of divine lineage, claiming descent from an ancient solar deity.
Their rule is marked by a claim of a deep connection to celestial magic and prophetic abilities.

##### Relation
Unlike other kingdoms, Luminia's ruling house remained relatively stable through [[The Devine War]], though many of their subsidiary noble houses were lost. The Dawnweavers maintain their position through both "divine right" and the support of powerful religious institutions.

##### History
The Dawnweaver's originated from their ancestor's ability to "manipulate" the morning sun's light during the kingdom's founding.
Originally priests of the ancient sun temple, they gradually transformed into a ruling dynasty as their prophetic abilities and "celestial" magic became crucial to the kingdom's survival.
