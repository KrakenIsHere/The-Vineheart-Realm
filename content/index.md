## Rules

Here the rules and general concept follows **Dungeons & Dragons 5e** with a few exceptions and additions all listed within the following documents:
- [[Gameplay Changes]] 
- [[Bastions Changes]]

> [!Note] Notable Changes
> Some changes have been adjusted to either limit or remove limits for players, such as:
>- Lowering money made from Bastions
>- Expanding on EXP & Rest mechanics
>- Limiting touch-based spells
>	- Extending touch through other spells


## Gameplay

As with the rules the general gameplay is based on **Dungeons & Dragons 5e**. However, as with most things, NERDS tend to over complicate shit.

So some aspects of the game will be simplified, depending on the situation. And some elements will be loosely based (or a straight up ripoff) off of **Baulder's Gate 3** in the name of having fun, and not being lame rule sticklers.
