# PvP Scenarios

If a PvP scenario is determined the DM shall give the player(s) affected, a temporary & limited taste of the godhood the DM possess.

## Divine Victim's Right

When a player betrays the sacred bonds of fellowship by raising arms against their companion, the gods take notice. The wronged soul is temporarily blessed with a fragment of divine authority - a sacred gift meant to restore balance and remind all that treachery carries consequences.

This blessing is not granted lightly, nor is it a tool for revenge. It represents the gods' intervention to protect those wrongfully attacked by their trusted allies. Those who receive this blessing often report feeling a warm golden light flowing through them, accompanied by a sense of righteous purpose.

However, wielding even a fraction of divine power requires great responsibility. The blessed must show restraint and wisdom, using these gifts only to defend themselves and restore peace. Abuse of this divine trust or attempting to extend vengeance beyond self-defense will result in the immediate withdrawal of these powers.

Let this serve as a reminder: The bonds between adventurers are sacred, and those who break them face not just mortal consequences, but divine judgment.

## Activation

# Luck Events
A rare magical phenomenon where fortune itself seems to twist in unexpected ways, causing reality to briefly align with a character's desires despite all odds.

## Examples

### Ex 1
While talking to a king, a request comes up and as the king is about to reject the request in a bold and loud fashion. What he says is accepting the request and accommodating it, leaving both the monarch and his courtiers confused but bound by the royal word.

### Ex 2
A merchant counts out payment for an item, and despite clearly placing down only 8 gold pieces, when counted again there are 10 - the exact price of the item being purchased. Both the merchant and buyer are certain of their original counts but cannot deny the present reality.

### Ex 3
While fleeing from guards, a character turns down an alley they're certain is a dead end, only to find a previously non-existent door that leads exactly where they need to go. Later, the alley is indeed a dead end.

## Usage

### Trigger
Luck Events can be triggered in two ways:
- Narrative Triggers: When a player describes their character desperately hoping or wishing for something specific in a crucial moment
- Mechanical Triggers: When a player rolls a natural 20 on a skill check while under significant stress or during a dramatically appropriate moment

### Rolls
When a Luck Event is triggered, the DM can use these rolls to determine the nature and extent of the fortunate twist:

- Intensity Roll (d20): Determines how dramatically reality bends
- Consequence Roll (d12): Determines what unforeseen effects might follow

#### Effect

| d20 (Intensity) | Effect Level  | Example Manifestation           |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1-5             | Minor Twist   | Small convenient coincidences   |
| 6-10            | Moderate Luck | Favorable misunderstandings     |
| 11-15           | Major Fortune | Reality briefly rewrites itself |
| 16-20           | Miraculous    | The impossible becomes possible |

#### After Effects

|d12 (Consequence)|After-Effect|
|---|---|
|1-3|None|
|4-6|Minor inconvenience later|
|7-9|Someone becomes suspicious|
|10-12|The universe balances itself (DM's choice)|


# Chaos Events
A surge of wild magic that causes reality to hiccup and strange effects to manifest.

## Examples

### Ex 1
During a heated argument in a tavern, all the liquid in everyone's cups suddenly floats upward, forming dancing shapes in the air before returning to their vessels - but now each drink has changed to a different beverage.

### Ex 2
A wizard casting a simple light spell suddenly finds their magic transformed, causing all shadows in a 30-foot radius to become solid and begin dancing.

### Ex 3
Mid-conversation, everyone within 20 feet suddenly speaks in rhyming verse for one minute, unable to communicate any other way.

## Usage

### Trigger
- When multiple spells are cast in the same area
- On critical failure of a spell check
- Near places of high magical concentration
- During heightened emotional states of spellcasters

### Rolls
- Volatility Roll (d20): How powerful the chaos manifestation is

# Doom Events
Dark portents and grim occurrences that herald significant threats or changes.

## Examples

# Divine Events
Moments when the gods themselves take notice and interact with mortal affairs.

## Examples

### Ex 1
A paladin's holy symbol suddenly glows with divine light, and their next statement carries the weight of divine law, compelling even the most stubborn opponent to listen.

During a crucial moment, time briefly stops as a divine messenger appears to offer guidance or warning.
