Humans are the most common people in the Vineheart Realm, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. 
Not every intelligent race is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. 

Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties.

Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and Tieflings are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play.

> [!INFO] Example
> A Halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a Dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an Elf can be a master of arcane magic. Your character's race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story.

Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.
These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race.

It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.
