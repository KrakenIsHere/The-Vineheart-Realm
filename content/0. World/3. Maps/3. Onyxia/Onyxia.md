## History
(WIP)

Named after the onyx that form in the northern mountain range, Onyxia stands as a testament to natural wealth and architectural grandeur. Connected to [[Arcanum]] through the bustling port city of [[Bayshore]], and to [[Luminia]] via [[Sapphirebay]] & [[Coralbay]].

### Royalty
The continent was traditionally ruled by the royal house of **Shadowrest**, masters of both commerce and diplomacy. During the [[The Devine War]], the Shadowrest dynasty maintained their hold through careful maneuvering, though many of their closest allies fell.

#### The House of Shadowrest
The ruling family gained prominence through their control of the continent's valuable mineral trade. Unlike other noble houses, the Shadowrests were originally mining barons who earned their titles through economic influence rather than military might.

##### History
The Shadowrest line traces their noble legitimacy through marriage to the youngest daughter of the former ruling house of **Obsidia**. When the Obsidia line ended during [[The Devine War]], the Shadowrests' combination of economic power and royal blood made them the clear successors.
