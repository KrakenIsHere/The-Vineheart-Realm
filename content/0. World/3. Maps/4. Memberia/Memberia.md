## History
(WIP)

The name Memberia comes from the ancient word "Memor" meaning "memory," referring to the continent's vast libraries and centers of learning. Connected to Arcanum through the industrial powerhouse of Ironshore, and to Luminia via the Scholar's Bridge.

### Royalty
House **Sapient** rules Memberia, having risen to power through their mastery of both magical and mundane knowledge. They survived [[The Devine War]] by using their vast magical archives to protect their territories.

#### The House of Sapient
The Sapients distinguish themselves through their tradition of requiring all family members to master at least three schools of magic before taking any position of authority. Their rule is characterized by a council-style governance where wisdom is valued above birthright.

##### Relation
The current ruling branch of house Sapient gained legitimacy through their maternal connection to the previous ruling house of **Memoria**. When the last Memoria heir fell during [[The Devine War]], the Sapients were chosen for both their blood ties and their unparalleled magical expertise.

##### History
The Sapient family began as a guild of scholars and mages who founded the first magical university in Memberia. Their transformation from academics to rulers came gradually as their influence over magical education made them indispensable to the previous monarchy.
