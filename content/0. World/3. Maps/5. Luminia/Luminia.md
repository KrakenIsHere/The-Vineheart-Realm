## History
(WIP)

Luminia takes its name from the eternal aurora that dances in its skies, a phenomenon said to be a blessing from the gods themselves. Connected to Onyxia through the Obsidian Gate and to Memberia via the Scholar's Bridge.

### Royalty
The royal house of **Dawnweaver** rules Luminia, having maintained their position through [[The Devine War]] by harnessing the continent's unique celestial energies. They are said to be blessed with the ability to communicate with the aurora itself.

#### The House of Dawnweaver
The Dawnweavers are unique among the continental rulers for their direct divine lineage, claiming descent from an ancient solar deity. Their rule is marked by a deep connection to celestial magic and prophetic abilities.

##### Relation
Unlike other continents, Luminia's ruling house remained relatively stable through [[The Devine War]], though many of their subsidiary noble houses were lost. The Dawnweavers maintain their position through both divine right and the support of powerful religious institutions.

##### History
The Dawnweaver name originated from their ancestor's ability to manipulate the aurora lights during the continent's founding. Originally priests of the sun temple, they gradually transformed into a ruling dynasty as their prophetic abilities and celestial magic became crucial to the continent's survival.
