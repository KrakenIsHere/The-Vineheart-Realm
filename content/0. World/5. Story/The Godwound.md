# The Scar
(WIP)

At the core of the realm lies the Godwound, an eternal scar upon reality itself - a testament to the cataclysmic forces that shaped the new realm. This cosmic injury bleeds divine energy into the fabric of existence, warping and reshaping reality.

## Nature
The Godwound is not merely a physical location, but a metaphysical tear in reality's tapestry. It pulses with the residual power of creation itself, a reminder of the violent birth of this realm.

## Manifestations

### The Raging Seas
- The oceans churn with supernatural fury, their waves reaching impossible heights
- Whirlpools appear and disappear without warning, some leading to otherworldly depths
- Ancient leviathans rise from the depths, their forms twisted by divine energy
- Ships report phantom lights and mysterious songs that lead sailors astray
- Entire sections of ocean sometimes freeze or boil without explanation

### Corrupted Wildlands
- Forests shift their locations under cover of darkness
- Trees grow in impossible shapes, sometimes bearing fruit that grants strange visions
- Cave systems expand and contract like breathing organisms
- Ancient dungeons appear fully formed, as if they've existed for centuries
- Wildlife mutates, creating new and fearsome hybrid creatures
- Plants exhibit signs of sentience, responding to emotions and thoughts

### The Monster Gates
- Crystalline portals materialize in remote locations
- Each gate resonates with a unique frequency that attracts specific types of creatures
- Some gates are permanent, while others appear only under certain celestial alignments
- Local folklore often develops around recurring gate locations
- Communities build watchtowers and warning systems near known gate sites

### Enhanced Natural Disasters
- Storms carry whispers of ancient languages
- Earthquakes reveal long-buried ruins and artifacts
- Lightning strikes leave behind deposits of magical crystals
- Volcanic eruptions spew forth not just lava, but primordial entities
- Avalanches and landslides often uncover or seal away powerful artifacts

## Effects on Society

### Adaptation
- Communities have developed complex warning systems and evacuation protocols
- Specialized guilds of monster hunters and gate wardens protect settlements
- Scholars study the Godwound's patterns, attempting to predict its manifestations
- Trading routes are regularly redrawn to account for shifting dangers
- Architecture has evolved to withstand supernatural disasters

### Cultural Impact
- Religious orders debate the meaning and purpose of the Godwound
- Different cultures interpret and worship its power in various ways
- Artifacts and resources created by its influence are highly valued
- Some seek to harness its power, while others work to contain it
- Prophecies speak of both doom and salvation tied to its existence

## The Cycles
The wound's influence waxes and wanes according to mysterious patterns. Having periods of heightened activity:
- Magic becomes more potent but unstable
- Monsters appear with greater frequency
- Natural disasters increase in intensity
- Ancient prophecies begin to fulfill themselves


## The Containment Rituals
Each of the four continents must perform a sacred ritual during the winter solstice, when the Godwound's energies are at their most volatile. These rituals, collectively known as the Binding of the Four, serve to maintain the delicate balance of power that prevents the wound from overwhelming the realm.

### The Memberian Ritual
#### Frost Tethering
- Performed in the frozen wastes of the northern continent
- Requires the combined effort of their most powerful ice mages
- Crystal formations are used to channel and freeze excess divine energy
- Failure results in devastating magical winter storms and ice monsters
- The ritual involves a month-long preparation of special ice crystals that can contain divine energy

### The Luminian Ritual
#### Wind Weaving
- Takes place atop their highest mountain peaks
- Sky shamans create massive aerial formations to disperse harmful energies
- Uses ancient wind chimes forged from meteoric metal
- Failure leads to devastating hurricanes and flying monstrosities
- Requires precise timing with specific wind patterns

### The Onyxian Ritual
#### Flame Binding
- Conducted within their most active volcano
- Fire priests channel excess energy into the planet's core
- Uses sacred flames that have burned for thousands of years
- Failure causes volcanic eruptions and fire elementals to run rampant
- The ritual requires rare combustible materials gathered throughout the year

### The Arcanian Ritual
#### Tide Sealing
- Performed at the edge of their deepest ocean trench
- Water mystics create magical barriers to contain sea monsters
- Uses sacred pearls charged with moonlight throughout the year
- Failure results in massive tidal waves and sea creature attacks
- Requires cooperation between multiple coastal temples

### Ritual Coordination
- All four rituals must be completed within the same 48-hour period
- Ancient communication systems are used to coordinate timing
- Each continent sends observers to the others to ensure proper execution
- The success or failure of each ritual affects the others
- Political tensions must be set aside for the greater good

### Cultural Impact of the Rituals
- Major festivals and celebrations surround the ritual period
- Trade routes and warfare cease during preparation time
- Children are taught the importance of the rituals from an early age
- Some see the rituals as a burden, others as a sacred duty
- Each continent has developed unique traditions around their role

### When Rituals Fail
- Historical records tell of catastrophic failures
- Emergency procedures exist for partial ritual success
- Backup sites are maintained in case primary locations are compromised
- Some continents have developed emergency containment measures
- Failed rituals can take years to recover from

### The Sacred Priestesses
At the heart of each continent's ritual stands a Godwound Priestess - women chosen from birth and trained to become living repositories of ancient knowledge. These priestesses are both guides and catalysts, their very beings attuned to the Godwound's energies.

#### Selection and Training
- Potential priestesses show signs at birth (birthmarks, unusual red eyes, and high magical sensitivity)
- Only one can serve at a time for each continent
- Training begins as early as at age seven and continues until ascension
- Multiple candidates are trained, but only one can be chosen
- The training process involves both scholarly study and magical attunement
In the event that a candidate cannot be 

#### The Priestess's Role

- Carries the complete knowledge of ritual procedures in their memory
- Can sense disturbances in the Godwound's energy
- Their blood contains properties necessary for certain ritual components
- Maintains mental connections with other continental priestesses

#### The Burden of Knowledge

- When combined, their knowledge reveals the complete truth about the Godwound
- They are forbidden from sharing certain secrets except with their successor
- Their dreams are often prophetic, showing potential futures
- The role takes a physical toll, often shortening their lifespan

#### Succession
- Current priestesses help identify their potential successors
- The transfer of knowledge occurs through a dangerous mystical ceremony
- If a priestess dies before passing on their knowledge, emergency measures exist
- Some knowledge can only be transferred at specific celestial alignments
- Failed transfers have led to lost knowledge and ritual adaptations


### The Memberian Priestess
#### The Frost Speaker

### Political Implications
- Priestesses must remain politically neutral
