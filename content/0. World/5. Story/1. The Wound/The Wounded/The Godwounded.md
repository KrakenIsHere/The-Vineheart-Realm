# Keepers of the Godwound
*"To quell the wound is to bear the world"* - First Doctrine of The Wounded

## Overview
The Wounded stands as an intricate organization dedicated to understanding, containing, and preserving the balance of The Godwound's chaotic energies. While the Four Wounded Priestesses serve as the primary conduits of ritual knowledge, they are supported by a vast network of devoted individuals organized into precise hierarchical circles, each playing a crucial role in maintaining the delicate equilibrium between order, safety and chaos.

At its core, the organization operates through four continental temples, each housing a Priestess whose very being is attuned to The Godwound's energies through ancient ceremonies and lifelong training. These temples - Memberian, Luminian, Onyxian, and Arcanian - have evolved to reflect their environments and the unique containment rituals performed within their kingdoms.

The Wounded maintains its authority through a careful balance of scholarly pursuit and practical action, with roles ranging from the scholarly Wound Scribes who document manifestations, to the vigilant Guardians who protect the sacred sites and Priestesses across all kingdoms. Their influence extends beyond political boundaries, operating as a neutral entity devoted solely to their sacred mission of containing The Godwound's power.

> Following The Godwound's appearance, The Wounded emerged within two decades, rapidly establishing themselves as the foremost authority on understanding and containing its mysterious powers.

> Their organization combines ancient traditions with pragmatic adaptation, ensuring their continued relevance in an ever-changing world.


## Organizational Structure

### The Inner Circle

- **The Four Priestesses** - The living conduits of ritual knowledge.
The Four Priestesses stand as living conduits of ritual knowledge, their very beings attuned to [[The Godwound]]'s energies through ancient ceremonies and lifelong training. Each priestess carries within them the ritual knowledge.

Their bodies bear the physical marks of their connection to [[The Godwound]].


- **The Echo Chamber** - A council of former priestess candidates who serve as advisors.
The Echo Chamber serves as both council and safeguard, composed of former priestess candidates who came close to ascending but ultimately did not.

Their incomplete attunement to [[The Godwound]] grants them unique insights into its workings without the full burden borne by a priestesses. They serve as advisors, caretakers, and emergency vessels of knowledge should a priestess fall before passing on their wisdom.


- **The Wound Scribes** - Scholars who document [[The Godwound]]'s manifestations.
Wound Scribes devote their lives to documenting every manifestation of [[The Godwound]]'s influence.
Their libraries contain countless volumes of carefully recorded observations, theoretical works, and predictive models.

These scholars often bear ritual scarification that enhances their ability to sense and interpret the wound's emanations, their bodies becoming living records of their studies.


- **The Memory Keepers** - Responsible for preserving non-ritual knowledge and history.
Memory Keepers preserve the broader context of history and non-ritual knowledge, understanding that [[The Godwound]]'s effects ripple through every aspect of society.

They maintain oral traditions, written records, and magical memory crystals that capture not just events, but the very essence of experiences related to the wound's influence.

### The Outer Circle

- **Seekers** - Identify and evaluate potential priestess candidates.
Seekers typically operate in pairs, traveling their continent in search of potential priestess candidates.
Attempting to identify children who bear the marks of a potential Priestess.


- **Guardians** - Protect priestesses and sacred sites.
Guardians serve no lord nor deity, and operate like a private military, with the sole purpose of protecting the priestesses.
They are the only branch, that continuously operates between kingdoms & continents seamlessly.

It is recognized that Guardians is a singular unit across the branches ensuring the complete protection of ALL priestesses.

- **Ritualists** - Support staff for the containment rituals.
Ritualists help priestesses during rituals where needed, such as with the ritual itself for preparations and as mana batteries or with chants.

They're responsible for updating the Gatherers if changes of what is required for the ritual to ensure that all resources are gathered for the [[Wound Containment]] rituals for their respective regions.


- **Gatherers** - Collect necessary materials for rituals.
Gatherers ensure the required recourses, for the [[Wound Containment|rituals]] are available when the ritual begins.

They travel the realm for recourses and sometimes find new way to procure rare materials or even manages to farm resources that were previously considered impossible.


- **Observers** - Monitor the Godwound's activity across the realms.
Observers provide the necessary information to help contain the effects of [[The Godwound]] and to evolve the effectiveness of the rituals performed by the [[Wounded Priestesses]].

Their observations are crucial for ensuring that the rituals are timely and effective, helping to maintain the delicate balance of power that presumably prevents [[The Godwound]] from overwhelming the realm.


### Support Roles
The support roles are crucial, as they provide the backbone for the organization's efforts to monitor, document, and contain the Godwound's influence, ultimately aiding the [[Wounded Priestesses]] in their vital rituals.
The structured approach to training and advancement ensures that the organization remains effective and resilient in the face of the Godwound's challenges.

- Each position has different training requirements.
- Many begin training in childhood.
- Some roles are hereditary.
- Cross-training is encouraged for flexibility.
- Advancement is based on merit and dedication.


## Sacred Sites

Each continental temple has evolved to reflect both its environment and the unique rituals they perform.
