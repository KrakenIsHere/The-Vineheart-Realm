# The Rituals

## Ritual Coordination
- All four rituals must be completed within the same 48-hour period
- Rituals are set to be done at the months of Janbuary-Marpril & Jugust-Septober at the first full moon of the months
- The success or failure of each ritual affects the others


## Cultural Impact of the Rituals
- Major festivals and celebrations surround the ritual period
- Some see the rituals as a burden, others as a sacred duty
- Each continent has developed unique traditions around their role


## When Rituals Fail
- Historical records tell of catastrophic failures
- Emergency procedures exist for partial ritual success
- Some continents have developed emergency containment measures
- Failed rituals can take years to recover from
