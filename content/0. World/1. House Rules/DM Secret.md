## PvP Scenarios

If a PvP scenario is determined the DM shall give the player(s) affected, a temporary & limited taste of the godhood the DM possess.

### Divine Victim's Right

When a player betrays the sacred bonds of fellowship by raising arms against their companion, the gods take notice. The wronged soul is temporarily blessed with a fragment of divine authority - a sacred gift meant to restore balance and remind all that treachery carries consequences.

This blessing is not granted lightly, nor is it a tool for revenge. It represents the gods' intervention to protect those wrongfully attacked by their trusted allies. Those who receive this blessing often report feeling a warm golden light flowing through them, accompanied by a sense of righteous purpose.

However, wielding even a fraction of divine power requires great responsibility. The blessed must show restraint and wisdom, using these gifts only to defend themselves and restore peace. Abuse of this divine trust or attempting to extend vengeance beyond self-defense will result in the immediate withdrawal of these powers.

Let this serve as a reminder: The bonds between adventurers are sacred, and those who break them face not just mortal consequences, but divine judgment.

## Custom Effects

### Plot Armor
*A mystical protection that bends fate itself*

**Duration:** Permanent
**Type:** Story Effect

Useful effect
1. "Teleportation"
	Happens to appear in locations it makes no sense for them to be.
2. Survives ridiculous events
	Falls
	Traps

When a character with Plot Armor would die from any effect, they instead:
1. Drop to 1 HP
2. Gain temporary immunity to all damage until the start of their next turn
3. Mark one use of Plot Armor
4. Roll on the Dramatic Consequence table

The effect can be used X times. After all uses are expended, the character becomes vulnerable to death as normal.

#### Narrative Description
Your very existence seems to defy fate. Death itself appears reluctant to claim you, as if you have some greater purpose yet unfulfilled. While others might perish from a fatal blow, you find yourself barely clinging to life, saved by improbable circumstances.


#### Dramatic Consequences (roll 1d6)
1. **Lasting Scar** - Disadvantage on Charisma checks for **1d4** days
2. **Haunting Visions** - Disadvantage on Wisdom saves for **1d4** days
3. **Weakened Spirit** - Maximum HP reduced by 10 until next long rest
4. **Death's Mark** - Healing received is halved for **1d4** days
5. **Fate's Debt** - Next death saving throw is made with disadvantage
6. **Soul Drain** - Lose one unused Hit Die

#### Notes
- Track uses discretely
- Consider incorporating near-death experiences into character development
- Can be restored during major story beats if dramatically appropriate
