# Custom Effects

## Plot Armor
*A mystical protection that bends fate itself*

**Duration:** Permanent
**Type:** Story Effect

**Useful effects:**
1. "Teleportation"
- Happens to appear in locations it makes no sense for them to be.
2. Survives ridiculous events
- Falls
- Traps

> [!INFO]
> When a character with Plot Armor would die from any effect, they instead:
> 1. Drop to 1 HP
> 2. Gain temporary immunity to all damage until the start of their next turn
> 3. Mark one use of Plot Armor
> 4. Roll on the Dramatic Consequence table
> 
> The effect can be used X times. After all uses are expended, the character becomes vulnerable to death as normal.

### Narrative Description
Your very existence seems to defy fate. Death itself appears reluctant to claim you, as if you have some greater purpose yet unfulfilled. While others might perish from a fatal blow, you find yourself barely clinging to life, saved by improbable circumstances.


### Dramatic Consequences (roll 1d6)
1. **Lasting Scar** - Disadvantage on Charisma checks for **1d4** days
2. **Haunting Visions** - Disadvantage on Wisdom saves for **1d4** days
3. **Weakened Spirit** - Maximum HP reduced by 10 until next long rest
4. **Death's Mark** - Healing received is halved for **1d4** days
5. **Fate's Debt** - Next death saving throw is made with disadvantage
6. **Soul Drain** - Lose one unused Hit Die

> [!NOTE]
> - Track uses discretely
> - Consider incorporating near-death experiences into character development
> - Can be restored during major story beats if dramatically appropriate
