# Session 1
## Adventurers enter the cave

The adventurers Tronga and Fistor finds themselves in a dark cave full of dead goblins.
- They move further down into the cave, but do not find much of interest either in the cave or on the goblin bodies.

Suddenly they find a chest and pick up a potion of Growth and a Miner's Pick.
- Fistor takes the items in his inventory and they move along.

- After some good stealth and illusions they manage to do a surprise attack on the goblins.

After a brutal battle the adventurers defeated the 6 goblins in the camp, and;
- Fistor gets an amazing new Scimitar for all the trouble.
- 
Further exploring the camp,
- Tronga hears a snoring goblin and sneaks in to the tent and murders the goblin while its having a horrible nightmare.

They go around and explore the camp for a while and finds
- a potion of healing, 2 goblin Moonshines, 
- some goblin grease, 
- some goblin glue
- two potions of greater healing 
- and a set of thieves tools.

After a short rest they go a little further still smashing rocks in their way.
- One rock leads to a path with another stone, 
- and behind the stone they hear heavy breathing from a large beast. 
- They decide to go find another rock to smash 
- and find a ladder that leads further down to the depths of the cave. 
- After a quick look they decide to go back up and take a long rest to replenish their mana before venturing further.

## To the depth

The next day the adventurers venture down the ladder. 
- After stepping over some goblin bodies they attack some animated armors along the path. 
- After poking and stabbing, the armors became lifeless once more.

End of session one.

# Session 2

## To the depth

After defeating the not so threatening armors, 
- the adventurers can finally take a breath and starts to notice a bit about where they are. 
- The place now looks more like a room or hallway then a cave. 
- They have a sickening feeling that they have found a secret way into a castle of some kind.

After some relaxed planning 
- they decide to go back up to the cave to loot what more they can to help them go further into the cryptic castle.

After a long beauty nap in the slain goblin camp,
- they decide to check what is going on behind the rock with the snoring sounds behind it. 
- Tronga cast speak with animals on herself and tries to introduce herself to the rock. but all she can hear is more snoring. 
- After some back and forth with this, 
- Fistor takes to his pick and thwacks it into the rock and they find a hungry and grateful bear on the other side.

Tronga and the bear have a nice roaring conversation and the bear decides to join the adventurers. 
- Therefore the party of two not has Bern the brown bear on the team.

With their new follower they try to explore more of the cave and find a disgusting gelatinous cube. 
- With the extra claws they defeat the cube before it can even react. 
- They loot the chest he was hiding and find 3 vails of poison.

Filled with the rush of an easy kill and the comfort of a companion they find their way to the entrance where they entered the cave. 
- At once Bern the bear runs off to the free sunlight, and the party is down to two adventurers again. 
- A little sad for loosing their new buddy after just a few minutes and one battle, 
- they make their way down to the building structure again in the deep bellow.

Back down they go through the first door and find a nice circular room with some dirty windows and a chest. 
- Tronga opens the chest and finds a jar of exotic spices, and the book 'A Cartographer's Guide Vol. 3'. 
- Being careful for the road ahead, 
- they listen to the next two doors and decide to move to the room with some hushed aggravated voices.

They open the door and find more animated armor. 
- Fistor remembers that secret hidden spaces is used for hiding treasures and that armor were usually places in front of them. 
- However, these spaces seem empty, so they follow the sounds to the next door.

After following the signs of frustration they find an undead cartographer Revenant, 
- who gives them a riddle that he is working on and its his life's mission to figure it out. 
- After some intuitive thinking Tronga figures out the answer to the riddle might be 'River'. 
- The Revenant is ecstatic by the answer and finds a hidden drawer with a hidden compass
- The compass' inscription brings the Revenant to tears. 
- He offers his assistance to the two adventurers, and they decide to call him Striker.

Thrilled and over confident by again being a party of three they go on ahead. 
- Exploring more of the missed doors they first find a massive spider sitting on a bed of cobwebs, they slowly close that door again. 
- The second door has a thin room with three portraits of a king, neither of them recognize the king. 
- Further rooms leads them to what looks like a bedroom, 
- Fistor takes a look inside and blissfully walks inn. 
- The second he steps past the door he can see a skeleton in the bed sit up and ready itself for attack.
- With the help of Striker they strike down the skeleton as if it was nothing. 

The next door leads the group to to a big hallway that has multiple doors. 
- The first door leads to a bath house. 
- The next room had one single chest in it. 
- Fistor tries everything to open this locked chest, at the end he gets mad and askes Tronga to put the chest on fire. 
- She does, and the chest bursts into flames quickly and burn the content to a crisp with the chest itself. 
- Since they already had a nice cozy fire, the group took advantage of it and took a short rest with the fire.

After some nice smores and rest, they check out the last door in the hallway.
- This door leads them back to the first place they were with the ladder leading back up to the cave. 
- They move back to where they were previously and continue down a path to the north they had not gone before.

The first door they check had two animated armors and Tronga is intrigued after they turn and look at her. 
- Fistor notices this and climbs in between Trongas legs and asks them is they are friend or foe. 
- The armors have no response and turns away. 
- Fistor takes this as an open invitation and walks into the room. 
- Yet again they find themselves in a battle. 
- Luckily Striker is there to help them out, again, 
- and again they make it out alive.

The next room has what looks like stairs going down and a chest. 
- Firstor pulls out a charge stone and a scroll of Fireball. 
- He continues to use the charge stone right away and the potion of healing they have. 
- However, as Fistor tries to drink the potion the liquid seems off, and he reacts quickly and moves away in time for the liquid to jump out of the bottle. 
- The liquid reforms and turns into a terrifying mimic, and thus battle has erupted again.

After the shortest battle, 
- Having now taken more damage from the mimic
- Fistor tries again to drink a potion, but this time a potion of greater healing. 
- A little suspicious of the liquid this time he slowly swallows and feels the health come back into his body. 
- They decide to move down the stairs, moving further down into this depts of this mystic castle.

End of session 2

# Session 3

## To Death

1) The adventurers find themselves a level further down in the old castle. The room is surrounded with dead bodies that has obviously been there a long long time. Ahead, Tronga can see four armors, they don't look like much for now. Fistor notices that the torches are lit from magic that comes from the end of the hallway. They move down the hallway and notice the armors look towards them.

2) As Tronga reaches further down the long hallway, an armor moves in front of her to block her path. As the armors block the path, Fistor creates a minor illusion of the king they saw on the pictures upstairs. This makes the armors move back again, and they can follow further down the path of the hallway. They reach the end of the hallway and go down some more stairs.

3) After going down another level they get to a small room with a single door. Tonga opens the door slowly and she can see a big room with lots of hey and many skeletons. One of the skeletons is a dragon. That gives Fistor a thought; In the old days kings trapped dragons to store the power of the creature, so some kings locked up dragons. This seems to be one of those cases where the dragon has been locked up and died under captivity.

4) As Tronga steps into the room with the skeletons and down the stairs comes all the armors they avoided in the hallway. Then its battle time. After a brutal and the death of their friend Striker, they win the battle. Fistor who just survived, needed all the rest, and they snuggle up in one of the hay piles.

5) After a long rest in the hay, they look around the room and notice a white dragon egg in the big hay pile. After a lot of looking back and forth they figure out that this is a healthy white dragon egg. After more investigation and looking around, they want to bring the egg with them. Tronga drinks the potion of growth and she takes the egg on her back. After just a few steps she gets attacked by something on her back. The egg transforms into a mimic! Both Tronga and Fistor fights to their best abilities, but in the end they are killed by the happy little mimic. Thus our story of the adventurers Tronga and Fistor ends with them rotting along with the armor in the lowest parts of a forgotten castle.
