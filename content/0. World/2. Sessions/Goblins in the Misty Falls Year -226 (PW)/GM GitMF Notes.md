![[Misty Falls Dungeon 1.webp|500]]
### Areas

#### Bedroom
In this large room, the skeleton of a once "Great" king lays in the bed ahead

Once entering the room, (without a stealth check)
the skeleton will sit up, and pick up it's short sword to defend it's castle.

Looks in the direction of the intruders as if to say something.

> [!INFO] Insight Check
> It seems like the skeleton is trying to say "Come to take my treasure?!" the jaw bone keeps moving in as if in rage, yelling profanities at you

##### Creatures
- [Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775841-skeleton)

#### Map Room
When the players enter the map room, they find a frustrated Revenant in noble attire hunched over an old mapping table. Papers and maps are scattered about, covered in frustrated scribbles and notes. The Revenant explains he was once the kingdom's greatest cartographer, but his mentor left him one final riddle before passing away—a riddle he's been unable to solve even in undeath.

##### Creatures
- [Revenant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17196-revenant)

##### The Cartographer's Final Lesson
On the mapping table is a parchment with elegant handwriting that reads:

> [!INFO] The Letter
> _"My dearest pupil,_
>
> _You've mastered every technique I've taught, but wisdom lies beyond mere skill. Solve this final lesson:_
>
>> [!NOTE] The Riddle
>> What e'er doth course yet ne'er doth tread,
>> Oft murmureth, yet speaketh not a word,
>> Possesseth bower yet slumber hath forsook,
>> Beareth maw yet victuals ne'er absord?
>>
>> Descry the chart with orbs most clear,
>> Gaze o'erlong, thy sight shall sear,
>> Nearer than thy wit doth think,
>> 'Tis harder lest thou chance to blink.
>>
>> _Silent shaper of the realm,_ 
>> _Curveth, carveth 'neath its helm,_ 
>> _Where it wendeth, life taketh root,_ 
>> _Ancient might, beyond dispute._ 
>> _Kingdoms bow 'fore its fair grace,_ 
>> _As it windeth through time and space._
>
>_When you understand what shapes the land more than any king's decree, you'll find my final gift to you._
>
>_With pride,_ _Master Cornelius"_

> [!NOTE] The Translation
_What always flows but never walks,_ 
_Often murmurs, never talks,_ 
_Has a bed but never sleeps,_ 
_Has a mouth but never eats?_
>
> _Look at the map with clear eyes,_ 
> _Stare too long, your vision dies,_ 
> _Closer than you might believe,_ 
> _It's harder when you don't relieve._
>
>_Silent sculptor of the land,_ 
>_Curves and carves with patient hand,_ 
>_Where it passes, life takes root,_ 
>_Ancient power, absolute._ 
>_Cities bow before its grace,_ 
>_As it winds through time and space._

**The solution:**
"A river." When the players suggest this, the Revenant's eyes light up with recognition. He slides his hand along the edge of the mapping table where a small river is carved, revealing a hidden drawer.

Inside is a beautifully crafted compass with an inscription:
> [!NOTE] The Inscription
> "Not all who wander are lost. Your true north was always your passion. You've exceeded your master in every way."

**The Revenant**, finally understanding his mentor's final message, find peace and with tears of joy offer the players his assistance while within this domain.

#### Loot Room
Here 4 Animated Armors stand tall among other armor

At a distance the adventurers see a large bundle of webs at the end of the room

> [!NOTE] Perception Check
>At the end of the room is a large pile of "gold" (It's actually brass) coins and a chest entangled within **THICK** webs

#### Containment Room
Here a giant spider can be fought.
- The room is full of webs and is difficult to move through, walking speed is lowered by 20ft.

As the adventurers walk in the spider is resting laying on the ceiling the spider is fast asleep and doesn't wake up initially.

The adventurers look around and see skeletons of people and horses, some chained and some laying on what seems like a hay bed.

To the right is a table with cards on it (Ruined Playing Cards: Nature Themed) and 2 broken stools that has fallen over.

> [!NOTE] Speak with Animals
> As the spider wakes up and sees the adventurers it can be heard saying "Loose ends?"
