## History
Named after the onyx that form in the northern mountain range, Onyxia stands as a testament to natural wealth and architectural grandeur. Connected to [[Arcanum]] through the bustling port city of [[Bayshore]], and to [[Luminia]] via [[Sapphire Bay]] & [[Coral Bay]].

### Royalty
The continent was traditionally ruled by the royal house of **Shadowrest**, masters of both commerce and diplomacy. During the [[Devine War]], the Shadowrest dynasty maintained their hold through careful maneuvering, though many of their closest fell.
After gaining power, the capital Onyxia got renamed to [[Shadowvale]] to signify the change of the kingdom, and to honor the **Obsidia** the kingdom remains as the **Kingdom of Onyxia**

#### The House of Shadowrest
The ruling family gained prominence through their control of the continent's valuable mineral trade. Unlike other noble houses, the Shadowrests were originally mining barons who earned their titles through economic influence rather than military might.

##### History
The Shadowrest line traces their noble legitimacy through marriage to the youngest daughter of the former ruling house of **Obsidia**. When the Obsidia line ended during [[Devine War]], the Shadowrests' combination of economic power and royal blood made them the clear successors.

### Re-Settlement
The early settlements of what was now Onyxia, were focused on getting the mines and raw material resources operational for trading and tool creation. This was in hopes of gaining the favor of the other kingdoms & islands.
With the farmland being neglected by the new king, a famine quickly set in, and the recultivation of food access got implemented. It was however, too late. As most skilled farmers & fishermen had either gotten too old to continue working or died with their knowledge.

This new era would have Onyxia trade for food & knowledge, heavily supported via trade with the island of [[Rubilande]].
Not quite what the new king had envisioned.

Trade ports were quickly established with [[Luminia]] via [[Coral Bay]] and [[Sapphire Bay]]
Trade with [[Arcanum]] however took a while to establish via [[Bayshore]] and [[Riverport]]
Trade with [[Memberia]] goes through [[Luminia]]
