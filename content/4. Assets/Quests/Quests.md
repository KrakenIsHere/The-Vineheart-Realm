## Axholm
Embedded in a mountain south of Phandalin is the dwarven fortress of Axholm, which has been sealed for years.
If a dragon attack is imminent, the people of Phandalin can evacuate and take refuge in Axholm.
To that end, someone needs to open the fortress and make it safe for habitation.
Once you accomplish these tasks, return to Townmaster Wester to collect a reward of 250gp.

## Butterskull Ranch
Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail!
Travel there with haste, assess the damage, and help any way you can. Alfonse Kalazorn, the ranch owner, is a retired sheriff who can reward you for your efforts.
If he's dead, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester with proof of Kalazorn's demise to receive a reward of 100gp.

## Dragon Barrow
The dragon that bests us is not the first to threaten this region.
Between here and Neverwinter lies the barrow mound of a warrior whose magical dragon-slaying sword helped fell a green dragon terrorizing the High Road a century ago.
Rumor has it the *dragon slayer* is buried there, too. 
Retrieve it, and let the sword be its own reward.

## Dwarven Excavation
Dwarf prospectors found ancient dwarven ruins in the mountains southwest of here and have begun an archaeological dig for treasure and relics. 
They need to be warned that a white dragon has moved into the area. 
Take the warning to them, then return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 50gp.

## Gnomengarde
A clan of reclusive rock gnomes resides in a small network of caves in the mountains to the southeast. 
The gnomes of Gnomengarde are known for their magical inventions. 
They might have something with which to defeat the dragon. 
Get whatever you can from them. 
If you bring back something useful and don't want to keep it for yourselves, Townmaster Harbin Wester will pay you 50gp for it.

## Loggers' Camp
Deep in Neverwinter Wood, along the river that flows west toward Neverwinter, is a logging camp. 
Every two months, Phandalin delivers fresh supplies to the camp, which is run by the half-brother of Phandalin's Townmaster, Harbin Wester. 
Berthen, the local provisioner, has prepared a new delivery. 
He needs someone to bear the supplies safely to the camp. 
Return to Harbin Wester with a notice of delivery signed by his half-brother, Tibor Wester, to claim your reward of 100gp.

## Mountain's Toe
The Mountain's Toe Gold Mine lies fifteen miles northeast of Phandalin.
The new overseer, Don-Jon Raskin, just made the trip from Neverwinter to Phandalin and needs to be escorted to the mine.
There's no telling what dangers lie between here and there.
Once you deliver Raskin safe and sound return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 100gp.

## Umbrage Hill
The local midwife - an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynn - lives by herself in a stone windmill on the side of a hill a few miles south of Phandalin.
With dragon sightings becomming common, it is not safe for her to be alone.
Urge Adabra to return to Phandalin.
Once she's safe, visit Townmaster Harbin Wester to claim a reward of 25gp.

## Woodland Manse
The orcs have fallen under the sway of evil spellcasters in Neverwinter Wood and have been sighted in growing numbers near Falcon's Hunting Lodge.
The spellcasters dwell in a ruined manse.
Falcon needs someone to make a preemptive strike against it.
Destroy the evil in the manse, then expect him to reward you.
