## Galeb Duhr

Eyes and Ears of the Earth

**Habitat:** Hill, Mountain; **Treasure:** Any

Luca Bancone[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-001.galeb-duhr.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-001.galeb-duhr.png)

Beings of living rock, galeb duhr seek harmony with the earth and give voice to the vibrations of stone. Their rocky bodies have limbs and facial features accented by gems, ores, and other minerals found in the surrounding earth.

Galeb duhr are effectively immortal, with lifespans similar in length to mountains. They don’t experience time or perceive danger as shorter-lived species do. Galeb duhr avoid danger by hiding from other creatures. When they do reveal themselves, they speak and act ponderously, but they often know much of the surrounding land and secrets within the earth. When motivated to action, galeb duhr slam into foes and animate nearby boulders to do the same.

Some mountain dwellers view galeb duhr as aloof allies and might entrust these long-lived beings with secrets or treasures for future generations. Others speak of galeb duhr songs, barely audible harmonizations by groups of galeb duhr that are said to influence earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Sculpted Sentinel Hidden in Plain Sight

**Habitat:** Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Any

Gargoyles are sculptures inhabited by elemental spirits. Wings and magic allow their heavy stone bodies to fly, and they often perch where they can blend in amid ornate architecture, rock formations, or mundane statues. Gargoyles usually serve the magic-users who conjured them into their bodies, but if left to their own devices, they might play cruel pranks and steal treasures to hoard in lofty lairs.

Gargoyles seek to ambush foes or creatures that trespass on their territories. With no biological needs and supernatural patience, these monsters might wait unmoving for months, revealing themselves only when conditions are perfect to attack. They tend to lurk where statuary seems commonplace or where terrain obscures the shape and color of their bodies.

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** Any

Quivering masses of acidic goo, gelatinous cubes wobble through narrow caverns and dungeons, engulfing anything in their paths. These Oozes are naturally transparent, making them difficult to see while they’re stationary. Creatures and objects that become stuck within these slimes are gradually dissolved.

Traits

**_Ooze Cube._** The cube fills its entire space and is transparent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube’s Engulf and has Disadvantage on the saving throw.

Creatures inside the cube have [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover), and the cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures inside itself at a time.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can pull a creature or an object out of the cube by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check, and the puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.

**_Transparent._** Even when the cube is in plain sight, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to notice the cube if the creature hasn’t witnessed the cube move or otherwise act.

Actions

**_Pseudopod._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +4, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 12 (3d6 + 2) Acid damage.

**_Engulf._** The cube moves up to its Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack). The cube can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube trait). _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 12, each creature whose space the cube enters for the first time during this move. _Failure:_ 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target is engulfed. An engulfed target is [suffocating](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SuffocationHazard), can’t cast spells with a Verbal component, has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a successful check, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space. _Success:_ Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead.

Lost Soul and Unquiet Spirit

**Habitat:** Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Any

Ghosts arise when living creatures die in a state of extreme emotion or having left an important task undone. These incorporeal spirits haunt locations that are meaningful to them, lingering until their business is complete or they’re put to rest.

Ghosts typically appear as semitransparent versions of the creatures they were in life, though some bear evidence of the wounds that killed them or have nightmarish distortions to their forms. Many have extreme reactions to actions, objects, or individuals that remind them of emotionally charged aspects of their lives. Particularly desperate or vengeful ghosts might possess the living to fulfill their ends.

Gibbering mouthers endlessly feed on and regrow their own amoeboid bodies—amorphous heaps roiling with eyes, teeth, and strange organs. These mind-bending terrors sing and scream, laugh and cry with a cacophony of voices ranging from disturbingly unnatural to shockingly familiar. They exist only to feed and to unleash their disdain for reality, their many maws dripping with otherworldly spittle.

Gibbering mouthers come into being in various unpleasant ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Gibbering Mouther Nascencies table to inspire what brought one of these horrors into being.

Alas, the Elder Elves made a fatal mistake. When the Dragon’s Tear comet next returned, the Vast Gate—still keyed to the Far Realm of alien entities—linked to the comet and opened again. And what emerged, ululating profanities, sang unnameable hungers into an unguarded world.

Githyanki were once an ordinary people, but the deeds of a vile mind flayer empire etched conflict on their being. Gaunt, humanlike creatures, githyanki have serrated ears and speckled skin ranging through shades of yellow, green, and brown. While some githyanki follow their own paths, many are influenced by a past that forever altered their fates.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-g#HistoryoftheGith)History of the Gith

Ages ago, a humanlike people were conquered by an empire of [mind flayers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer). The illithids manipulated this forgotten people through untold horrors, forced evolution, and psychic reshaping. Eventually one named Gith rose from among the captives and led a rebellion against their oppressors. Gith’s followers, who became known as the gith, defeated the mind flayers and shattered their vast empire.

The victory of the gith was short-lived. As Gith was forging her own burgeoning empire, a leader named Zerthimon challenged her. Zerthimon claimed Gith’s drive for vengeance and new conquests was evidence of species-wide mental programing laid by the mind flayers, biological manipulation that condemned her people to continued servitude. This claim split the gith into Gith’s followers, the githyanki (meaning “followers of Gith”), and Zerthimon’s followers, the [githzerai](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-g#Githzerai) (meaning “those who spurn Gith”), and sparked an ongoing conflict.

When Gith perished, her adviser, [Vlaakith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Vlaakith), assumed rule of the githyanki. Vlaakith’s line has continued to the githyanki’s current ruler, Vlaakith the Lich-Queen. This undead tyrant compels her people to wage endless wars against mind flayers, githzerai, and any others that threaten githyanki supremacy.

To slay in Vlaakith’s name is our greatest service. To die in her name is our last act of reverence.

Githzerai are gaunt, humanlike beings, physically identical to githyanki. They share a history with githyanki as creatures physically and psychically transformed by [mind flayers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer) (see the “[Githyanki](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-g#Githyanki)” section). Githzerai know that in body and mind, their species was manipulated by their former illithid oppressors. Rather than giving in to this programming, githzerai follow the teachings of their first leader, Zerthimon, and reshape their minds and bodies to find peace.

Githzerai psychically create serene, hidden sanctuaries in chaotic reaches of the multiverse. Most of these redoubts drift through the chaotic plane of Limbo, but githzerai conclaves can also be found in the Abyss, the Elemental Chaos, and the Feywild. Githzerai create these cloisters to hone their psionic abilities, to gain insights from the multiverse, and to avoid githyanki and mind flayers.

We githzerai crave a challenge, so that when Zerthimon returns, he shall find us ready. Thus we traveled to howling Limbo to make our new home.

Glabrezus embody delusion and predatory guile. These cunning demons know the most effective traps are those that individuals devise for themselves. Despite having massive claws and overwhelming physicality, glabrezus excel at using flattery and misdirection to coerce victims into isolating themselves and harming others.

In the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss), glabrezus act as lone hunters or deceitful advisers to greater demons. Glabrezus seek routes to the Material Plane and relish being summoned by magic-users. They eagerly serve mortals while tempting them to betray their allies and indulge in hubristic fantasies. A glabrezu strives to murder its summoner once the magic-user has committed irredeemable misdeeds and the mortal’s soul is surely condemned to the Abyss.

Your companion’s life, or what you’ve journeyed through infinity in search of! Make your choice.

A goblin boss, a goblin hexer, and a goblin Warrior prepare to strike against a bitter foe

Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness and ruin. They delight in wreckage—the louder, the more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better. Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting fires and tormenting livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots.

Goblins obey those who accomplish the wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users, or those capable of making the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their destructiveness toward banditry, sabotage, or war.

The deity Maglubiyet claims to be the god of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, and on the Infinite Battlefield of [Acheron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Acheron), the deity commands innumerable goblinoid legions. In ages long past, Maglubiyet witnessed the destructive propensity of goblinoids and relocated a population of them from the Feywild to his realm on the Outer Planes. Since then, hordes of these more martial-minded goblins have flourished, with some finding their ways to Material Plane worlds. These vicious invaders seek to sow ruin in preparation for their god’s conquest.

Gold dragons work to make the world a better place. The most powerful of the metallic dragons, these awe-inspiring dragons strive to protect that which is good and bend fate toward a brighter future. Their kind dispositions don’t prevent gold dragons from engaging in combat when necessary, though, and they exhale brilliant flames and weakening magic to rout their foes.

Gold dragons favor grasslands and pristine forests, frequently dwelling near awe-inspiring natural wonders or guarding monuments from ancient civilizations. In their lairs, gold dragons hoard coins and gems, but they frequently put their treasure to use in pursuit of greater goals. They often use their riches to buy rare lore books, pay informants, or patronize idealistic adventurers.

Bull-like Guardians with Petrifying Breath

**Habitat:** Forest, Grassland, Hill; **Treasure:** Any

Kai Carpenter[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-017.gorgon.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-017.gorgon.png)

A gorgon petrifies victims with its deadly breath, then tramples them to pieces

Resembling mighty bulls armored in iron plates, gorgons are lifelike automatons that seek to destroy all who enter their territories. In addition to goring foes with their deadly horns and trampling them under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of noxious gas.

Gorgons are created by magic-users to serve as guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is labor intensive and dangerous, with one method requiring the skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa, and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame of ensorcelled iron. If the process fails, petrifying gas emerges from the materials, creating a magical threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.

When magic-users create gorgons, they often enchant them to ignore those who confront the creature with a specific command key, usually a password or a specific signal. Once a gorgon is set to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the command key, the monster ignores that intruder so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns without again presenting the command key, the gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon’s territory must remain vigilant and aware of the monster’s exact position, or they risk being attacked by a gorgon they thought was no longer a threat.

Those who create gorgons strive to give them purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at command keys might be found among the records of a gorgon’s creator or in the area the gorgon protects—perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser’s final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon Command Keys table to inspire the word or signal that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.

Notable among my eccentric ancestor’s scattered designs was a schematic of a swamp-dwelling bovine monster and an ominous note: “Do better.”

Most gorgons are iron bulls wreathed in clouds of petrifying gas. Their metal plates vary in sheen and color, from sleek silver to pitted black. The oldest gorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely impedes their abilities. These gorgons’ stomping grounds are littered with the shattered remains of petrified foes. Many gorgons outlive their creators by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations have natural origins and territories. Most such gorgons continue to follow age-old commands, guarding sites long fallen to ruin.

Followers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the process of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal bodies glow with intense heat. When they charge their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to ensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.

Terrifying in scale and overwhelming power, goristros are giant demons capable of bringing cities to ruin. These demons embody senseless anarchy and nihilistic destruction, and they take special offense at creatures or structures that rival them in size. Castles, towers, giants, and beasts of war are all common victims of these monsters’ wrath.

Goristros resemble hunched, primeval minotaurs bearing the scars of Abyssal wars or wounds from mighty war machines. Their appearance reflects that of their creator, [Baphomet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layer600TheEndlessMaze), the demon lord worshiped by many evil minotaurs. Goristros stalk Baphomet’s Abyssal realm, known as the Endless Maze, and pulp any non-demons they encounter in that massive, magical labyrinth.

Plot and strategize, bait and scheme, but hubris is no armor against ruin incarnate, and greater beings than you have fallen under the onslaught of the Abyss.

From forbidden forest depths, green dragons whisper evils into the world and manipulate the lives of those who listen. Elusive, conniving, and egotistical, these chromatic dragons patiently prey on the fears of shorter-lived beings, corrupting and isolating them. Green dragons might lurk amid labyrinthine wildernesses for centuries without revealing themselves; even their most devoted followers might know them only as the voice of the woodlands or a whisper in their dreams.

Despite their might, most green dragons disdain physical violence, viewing combat as servants’ work and preferring to trick foes into dangerous or exploitative scenarios. These dragons collect “baubles” that embody their webs of manipulation and serve as tools of extortion, such as compromising documents, family heirlooms, and sentimental treasures.

Green dragons lair in ancient forests, often shaping stands of massive trees into compounds of interwoven branches, hollow trunks, and caverns amid mighty roots. They might also dwell amid forested ruins, particularly the former homes of those they’ve conquered.

The region containing an adult or ancient green dragon’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Beast Spies.** Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to understand Draconic and can communicate telepathically with the dragon while within 1 mile of the lair.

**Poisonous Thicket.** Ordinary plants growing within 1 mile of the lair poison the air around them. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 hour.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

The words of adult green dragons are as deadly as their poisonous breath. They are brilliant schemers that pride themselves on influencing communities near their lairs. They obsess over information and create vast spy networks. Many of these dragons seek magical methods of surveillance or domination, and they manipulate adventurers into hunting down lost magic to aid in such control.

Ancient green dragons are creatures of legend, rarely seen by their servants or foes. Via magic and well-hidden agents, these dragons stoke suspicion between allies and undermine noble works. As bonds fray, the dragons reap rewards of greater wealth and control. Eventually the ambitions of ancient green dragons stretch beyond their territories as they seek control over empires, planar realms, or death itself.

Green hags work bitter magic to foul all that is beautiful and pure. Whether alone or in covens of other hags, these ancient witches call on eerie forces, spreading corruption and plotting doom for those who earn their ire. Green hags are adept deceivers, and they use illusions to cloak themselves in unassuming forms, hoping to tempt innocents into peril. These hags often spirit their victims back to surreal lairs where they hold captives prisoner or cook them into monstrous meals.

Green hags frequently know strange magic or forgotten secrets, such as the weaknesses of villains, the locations of lost treasures, or the ways to break curses. They might trade such knowledge for rare magic or symbolic treasures. Roll on or choose a result from the Green Hag Bargains table to inspire what a green hag charges for its secrets.

With barbed tentacles sprouting from their brain-shaped bodies, grells hunt the lightless depths. These silent predators defy gravity, allowing them to strike from unexpected places, and they perceive their surroundings via sound and electrical fields. Their tentacles secrete paralytic venom, which prevents most creatures ambushed by grells from crying out before being dragged into the dark and consumed.

Grells are sapient beings, but their intellects and motivations are alien to most. They typically cooperate with one another only to defeat more powerful prey. Most demonstrate no interest in creating things or in communicating with other creatures, including their own kind.

Many grells pursue methods of traveling between worlds and planes of existence. They sometimes slip onto star-faring vessels or enter portals heedless of their destination. Roll on or choose a result from the Grell Explorations table to inspire why grells seek passage between realms.

Gricks are wormlike predators that burst from hiding—flailing and snapping—to consume whatever prey passes near. They hide in cavernous crags or amid deadfalls, the scattered bones and possessions of past meals the only evidence of their threat.

Gricks’ origins are unclear, but some suggest these creatures arise from natural worms or similar invertebrates mutated by magical phenomena. Many cite the presence of gricks in a region as evidence of portals to other planes of existence, legendary magic items, or powerful supernatural beings.

Griffons combine the features of raptors and big cats—most commonly eagles and lions—and possess the precision and ferocity of such predators.

Puppet of the Mind Flayer Menace

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** Any

John Tedrick[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-027.grimlock.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/07-027.grimlock.png)

Grimlocks are victims of biological manipulation by [mind flayers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer). To create grimlocks, illithids capture Humanoids, expose them to strange forms of Underdark radiation, and implant new directives into their brains. The process of creating a grimlock rends the creature’s mind such that no semblance of the individual’s former personality remains.

Grimlocks have shallow depressions rather than eyes. A sixth sense allows grimlocks to perceive their surroundings. Psychic energies from their transformations linger in grimlocks’ bodies, and they channel these eerie forces into their attacks.

Roll on or choose a result from the Grimlock Tasks table to inspire how grimlocks serve illithids.

Guardian nagas are immortal, serpentine scholars that possess perfect memories. They collect the histories and lore of those they live among, guarding cultures’ stories and passing them on to new generations with infallible accuracy. Guardian nagas that outlive their host civilizations might linger in whatever ruins remain, preserving the civilizations’ stories so their lost people might live on.

Guards protect people, places, and things, either for pay or from a sense of duty. They might perform their duties vigilantly or distractedly. Some raise alarms at the first sign of danger and defend their charges with their lives. Others flee outright if their compensation doesn’t match the danger they face.

To distinguish between Waterdeep’s different groups of guardians, keep this handy mnemonic in mind: the Guard guards the walls while the Watch watches all.

Guards are perceptive, but most have little martial training. They might be bouncers, lookouts, members of a city watch, or other keen-eyed warriors.
