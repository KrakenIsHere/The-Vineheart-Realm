## Half-Dragon

Warrior Created by Dragons

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Mathias Kollros[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/08-001.half-dragon.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/08-001.half-dragon.png)

Born through magical rites involving the essences of dragons, half-dragons serve their creators and their own draconic whims. Most half-dragons are created by chromatic dragons who desire servants with some trace of their own might and grandeur. Half-dragons frequently command other servants of a villainous dragon or act as agents in lands where their draconic master would attract unwanted attention.

Half-dragons share personality traits and agendas with the dragon who spawned them. Those resembling chromatic dragons typically loathe their creator even as they seek the same ends. Half-dragons with the traits of metallic dragons are especially rare, but they might arise through magical accidents, the efforts of reckless magic-users, or the last act of a dying dragon.

What blessing demands more yet inspires greater works than the blood of Tiamat?

—Wyrmlord Azarr Kul, Half-Dragon

Hate-filled creatures, harpies strive to cause pain and bring an end to love and life. These monsters combine humanlike features with the talons and wings of avian scavengers. Their notorious songs compel listeners to follow them, heedless of danger. Creatures captivated by a harpy’s song frequently meet their deaths on harpies’ vicious claws or amid natural perils.

Harpies dwell in remote, dismal places tainted by tragedy and despair. Some tales claim harpies offended the gods and were transformed as a punishment; harpies might also be the descendants of such cursed souls.

Every harpy sings a distinct song. While some songs are said to be heartbreaking in their beauty, others are wretched squawking and compel only the magically enthralled.

On their home planes of existence, these grim canines ensure that souls don’t escape their bleak afterlives. On the Material Plane, hell hounds typically serve cruel masters—such as fire giants and cultists—who appreciate their viciousness, obedience, and fiery characteristics. Hell hounds serve other creatures so long as they’re given opportunities to hunt and kill, but they’re quick to turn on those who treat them as mere animals.

Hell hounds have greater cunning than normal canines. They’re skilled trackers and work together well in packs, often employing tricks and ambushes. Hell hounds enjoy hearing prey scream in their scorching jaws and fiery breath. They often go out of their way to draw out the terror of their victims’ final moments.

A helmed horror proves immune to a mage’s Lightning Bolt spell

Helmed horrors are suits of armor animated by magic. Rather than being unreasoning automatons, these armored shells possess the guile of soldiers and resilience against destructive magic. While their name suggests sinister intentions, these creatures serve their creators loyally. Helmed horrors are also sometimes called doom guards or spirit armors. Most show no evidence of a personality, but exceptions exist.

Helmed horrors might perform any number of assignments. Roll on or choose a result from the Helmed Horror Directives table to inspire what tasks helmed horrors perform.

Demon of Obscenity and Outrage

**Habitat:** Planar (Abyss); **Treasure:** Any

Justin Gerard[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/08-005.hezrou.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/08-005.hezrou.png)

Hezrous compose the bulk of many demonic hordes. In croaking, reeking throngs, these ogre-size brutes seek to crush and consume foes. Their oozing hides are manifestations of embodied evils. Every few moments, patches of their slimy skins erupt with grotesque transformations such as rows of mismatched fangs, fungal growths, or half-formed features. These unsettling manifestations emerge, then roil away.

Hezrous serve more powerful demons, such as [nalfeshnees](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195140-nalfeshnee) and [mariliths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195117-marilith). They take the abuse and intimidation of these deadlier demons and pass it on to droves of weaker [dretches](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194974-dretch) and [manes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195114-manes). This predictable brutality makes hezrous useful links in the chaotic structure of a demonic horde.

When on the Material Plane or otherwise left to their own devices, hezrous recklessly indulge in destructive, short-sighted rampages. Only magic and threats from more powerful masters can curb these demons’ outrages and compel hezrous to pursue greater plots. Powerful spellcasters often use sinister coercions, spells like [Magic Circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619018-magic-circle) and [Planar Binding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618864-planar-binding), or other magic to force hezrous to serve them.

Hill giants live among rugged bluffs and highlands. Standing three times the size of most humans, these giants exhibit skin and hair in a range of shades, including hues suggestive of the earth and mosses near their dwellings.

Among hidden valleys, pristine waterfalls, and game-filled slopes, hill giants usually find their needs met by nature’s bounty. What the wilderness doesn’t provide, hill giants make, crafting clothes, tools, and weapons from rocks, wood, and hides. When they encounter strangers, hill giants might be suspicious and protective of their territories, but some might be convinced to share their bounties with travelers willing to entertain them.

Disaster, invasion, or want might drive hill giants from their homes into other people’s lands. Some displaced hill giants might steal what they need or seek revenge for their losses by causing ruin among smaller beings. Others might take up lives of raiding or serve other giants in return for protection.

A hobgoblin warlord oversees a hobgoblin captain and hobgoblin warriors marching to war

Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal.

Hobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond.

Many hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet, whose hunger for conquest matches their own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish in the Infinite Battlefield of [Acheron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Acheron), where they endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics and strange weapons, which they sometimes unleash on worlds of the Material Plane.

Hook horrors feed opportunistically on plants, fungi, and any creatures that come close enough to hook. To perceive their surroundings, hook horrors echolocate via a range of noises, from banging on rocks and their own bodies to vocalizations that sound like strange squawks, screams, or clicks. Only hook horrors know the meaning of these noises, but many people who explore the Underdark or live near deep-reaching caves have sought the sources of such sounds only to fall victim to hungry hook horrors.

Hydras are storied hero slayers with vicious, serpentine heads and infamous regenerative powers. Endlessly hungry, they devour any creatures they catch. Hydras that deplete an area of prey often go into a lengthy torpor until new prey arrives.
