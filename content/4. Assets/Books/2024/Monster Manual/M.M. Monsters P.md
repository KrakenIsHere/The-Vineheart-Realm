Winged, sapient horses of noble bearing, pegasi are as majestic as they are elusive. Most avoid the affairs of other creatures, preferring to dwell amid idyllic pastures or floating islands, or on other planes of existence. Others serve deities of the [Feywild](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Feywild) and Upper Planes, aiding heroes in need. In rare cases, pegasi might befriend virtuous people and serve as their companions and steeds.

Pegasi are hunted by servants of evil, leading many of these winged steeds to flee strangers on sight. Roll on or choose a result from the Pegasus Offerings table to inspire how one might show their good intentions to a wary pegasus.

Performer legends are celebrities known across nations, continents, or worlds. Their prestige might grant them access to the heights of society, or they might use their performances to manipulate audiences. Performer legends usually have signature traits or talents that set them apart from other entertainers, such as a distinct voice, incredible athleticism, or a unique manner of dress. They often travel with a retinue of other performers, guards, or noble patrons.

A peryton’s humanoid-shaped shadow suggests the monster’s supernatural origin

Perytons are monstrous predators that hunt people—particularly humans and elves—in favor of all other prey. With the bodies of mighty avian scavengers and fanged, stag-like heads, perytons use ambush tactics to dive-bomb travelers. Strangely, the shadows they cast resemble humanoid silhouettes. This supernatural oddity lends credence to stories that perytons are cursed humans or elves, or that they arise from carrion birds that feed on the corpses of villains.

Perytons tear out the hearts of those they slay, carrying the organs back to grisly lairs. This gives rise to numerous superstitions surrounding perytons. Roll on or choose a result from the Peryton Superstitions table to inspire why a peryton steals hearts.

Plane-Shifting Arachnid Ambusher

**Habitat:** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Planar (Ethereal Plane), Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Any

Phase spiders appear out of nowhere to attack, then vanish just as swiftly. These horse-size, magical arachnids are endemic to the [Ethereal Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#EtherealPlane). From vaporous lairs, they peer through the [Border Ethereal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#BorderEthereal) into the [Material Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#MaterialPlane). When they detect prey, phase spiders draw close and then shift or “phase” to the Material Plane to attack. They shift between planes of existence and attack from unexpected directions until they overcome their prey or are forced to retreat.

Phase spiders are more intelligent than mundane spiders, but most are cowards. They usually flee if they’re outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing them on the Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there. They make exceptions for ghosts and similar spirits, which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue as favored prey.

Aberrant Counterfeit Stalactite

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** [Individual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/creating-adventures#IndividualTreasure)

Piercers resemble stalactites, but each has a toothy maw and a single eye. They hang from cavern ceilings along routes frequented by denizens of the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe). Piercers might lurk for months at a time, waiting for any creature of their approximate size to pass underneath. When potential meals move below, piercers release their grip and plummet, intent on impaling prey in a single strike. If they’re successful, piercers consume their meals and then slowly climb to a new ambush position. If they miss or fail to slay their targets, piercers attempt to squirm away, but they’re easily dispatched by creatures aware of their presence.

Piercers are the larval form of ropers. Young piercers seek to move as far from ropers as they can to avoid ropers’ undiscerning hunger. Many piercers migrate vast distances through the Underdark, often to caverns or buried ruins near the surface.

Rule 8: Never trust a stalactite.

The term “pirate” encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.

Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.

Pirate captains command crews of pirates, dictating their destinations and targets. Captains cultivate fearsome and theatrical reputations, painting themselves as larger-than-life characters to terrorize their foes, ensure the obedience of their crews, and attract followers to their banner. Many have colorful nicknames inspired by signature traits and deeds.

Pirate admirals command whole pirate fleets. They undertake audacious ventures, such as challenging the navies of coastal nations, hunting legendary sea creatures, or carving out their own pirate kingdoms. Pirate admirals might launch their fleets from hidden fortresses where they hoard their treasure—or keep maps to where they’ve hidden their riches. Some pirate admirals ally with the followers of oceanic deities, underwater dwellers, and sea monsters, as well as their fellow scalawags.

Masterminds of the Nine Hells and generals of infernal legions, pit fiends seek conquests across the planes of existence. More than warmongers, these diabolical tyrants concoct intricate plots that play out among fiendish battlefields, infernal politics, and mortal conspiracies.

Pit fiends are the nobility of the Nine Hells, and many rule Lower Planar fiefdoms, doomed mortal worlds, and other infernal redoubts. Most serve archdevils of the Nine Hells as they pursue their own ambitions. Ranks of lesser devils obey pit fiends, but these cunning tyrants remain on guard against betrayal from their servants.

Smoldering with the evil of the Nine Hells, pit fiends strike fear in creatures with their mere presence. Despite their size and incredible physical and magical might, pit fiends are as likely to try to corrupt foes as they are to destroy them outright. Pit fiends’ arrogance can lead them to underestimate mortal foes—a failing that can lead to their downfall.

Priests harness the power of faith to work miracles. These religious adherents are as diverse as the faiths they follow. Some obey gods and their servants, while others live by age-old creeds. Belief guides priests’ actions and their magic, which they use to shape the world in line with their ideologies.

Roll on or choose a result from the Priest Roles table to inspire different sorts of priests.

By forging connections with divine beings and mastering mystical truths, archpriests become conduits for godly intentions and other supernatural forces. Their magic allows them to work wonders, whether to share the benevolence of their faiths or to vent divine wrath. Some archpriests attract vast followings as they claim to speak for divine forces, while others undertake personal spiritual journeys and seek to transcend mortal concerns.

Shining One, light my hours. Enkindle my soul, and inspire my deeds. Chase the shadows from my path, and let me walk in your brilliance.

Fickle, Pint-Sized Dragon

**Habitat:** Coastal, Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Urban; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely.

Crystal Sully[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/16-012.pseudodragon.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/16-012.pseudodragon.png)

Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.

Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures’ intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they’re considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.

Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don’t properly pamper their pseudodragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudodragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon’s taste in gifts.

|---|---|
|1|Flamboyant accessories it can wear.|
|2|Mementos from a lost friend or master.|
|3|Outlandish delicacies—like axe beak-egg omelets or mammoth-milk cheese.|
|4|The possessions of a sibling, rival, or master.|
|5|Shiny gifts, from gems to abalone shells.|
|6|Soft bedding and stuffed toys.|
|7|A specific cook’s signature dessert.|
|8|Time-consuming beauty treatments.|
|9|To hear a bedtime story or favorite song.|
|10|Trophies and important-sounding titles.|

If you want to keep a pseudodragon happy, get used to thinking of yourself as its familiar.

Titanic purple worms burrow through the earth and sand. Ever ravenous, they devour smaller creatures and ravage entire communities in their aimless burrowing.
