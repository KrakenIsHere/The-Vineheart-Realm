## Quaggoths

Unpredictable Subterranean Stalkers

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Beastly hunters endemic to subterranean depths, quaggoths scrape harsh existences from the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe). While they can survive on bitter lichens and toxic fungi, they viciously attack anything they can make a meal of, from giant spiders to explorers. Quaggoths sometimes serve as muscle for Underdark-dwelling villains.

Quaggoths frequently collect in small bands led by the most fearsome group member. These bands are proud and quick to hold grudges. Anyone who harms a quaggoth—or who is suspected of doing so—earns the enmity of that quaggoth’s band regardless of reason or fault. These grudges sometimes extend to whole communities rather than individuals. Generations of quaggoths might seek revenge against a settlement’s inhabitants for decades-old slights. Only the leader of a quaggoth band can demand that a grudge ends.

For quaggoths, every fight means life or death. They battle with wild fury and do anything to survive.

Demon of Discord and Disorder

**Habitat:** Planar (Abyss); **Treasure:** None

Tirelessly destructive, quasits sow discord through nasty pranks, sabotage, and ambushes. These tiny demons use chaos and violence to terrorize others. By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened creatures or by turning invisible, quasits sneak into places where they spy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding in dark places and—when least expected—bursting forth to slash foes with their poisoned claws.

Quasits are usually overlooked and underestimated by other demons. This drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless chaos, and they might find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists and magic-users.

Traits

**_Magic Resistance._** The quasit has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

**_Rend._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +5, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) Slashing damage, and the target has the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the start of the quasit’s next turn.

**_Invisibility._** The quasit casts [Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619116-invisibility) on itself, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

**_Scare (1/Day)._** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 10, one creature within 20 feet. _Failure:_ The target has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

**_Shape-Shift._** The quasit [shape-shifts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) to resemble a bat (Speed 10 ft., Fly 40 ft.), a centipede (40 ft., Climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., Swim 40 ft.), or it returns to its true form. Its game statistics are the same in each form, except for its Speed. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed.

A thing doesn’t need to be big to be gut-flippingly dreadful. Just think of all the folks who’re squeamish around spiders. Now imagine a spider as big as a cat and that wants to steal your tongue.
