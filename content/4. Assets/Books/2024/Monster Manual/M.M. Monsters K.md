## Kenku

Flightless, Noise-Mimicking Avian

**Habitat:** Forest, Planar (Shadowfell), Urban; **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables), [Individual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/creating-adventures#IndividualTreasure)

Kenku are birdlike folk who once soared the skies and sang enchanted songs, but a curse stole their wings and transformed their voices. Now kenku slip through the shadows of cities and the Shadowfell, trying to recover what they’ve lost. To some, this means seeking an end to their curse; others search for magic or contraptions to enable them to fly and sing again.

The curse affecting kenku allows them to vocally communicate only by mimicking sounds they’ve heard. Kenku can supernaturally re-create vast varieties of noises, from crying babies to running water and short phrases in others’ voices. Cunning kenku use their mimicry to deceive foes, lure creatures into ambushes, and signal to allies.

Cowardly cousins to chromatic dragons, kobolds serve draconic overlords as warriors and servants. These scrappy menaces mimic the behaviors of their dragon masters. Though their small stature and recklessness make kobolds poor imitators of dragons, what they lack in ferocity they make up for in zeal and ingenuity. They are especially adept at creating traps and setting ambushes.

Kobolds’ scales resemble those of chromatic dragons that live near their warrens. Rarely, kobolds possess features evocative of metallic dragons or other dragon-like creatures.

Leviathan of Legend

**Habitat:** Underwater; **Treasure:** Any

Ancient weapons of the gods, krakens slumber in the deepest oceanic abysses, awaiting their time to rise and dominate the world. These massive, many-tentacled horrors combine overwhelming physical might with formidable cunning. Their powerful limbs shatter ships and topple spires, and they use their control over storms to rain down lightning on their foes.

Krakens usually have little interest in mortal affairs. These terrors were created by the gods to wage war in ages long forgotten. Since that era, most krakens have vanished beneath the waves to slumber until the gods call on them again. Some krakens serve divine masters still, protecting deep sea treasures or entire oceans. Others have forsaken their divine creators and pursue their own agendas, manipulating forces beneath the sea and beyond.

Krakens rarely appear on the surface, but when they do, they herald times of change and doom. When roused to action, these titans directly attack coastal cities or whole armadas. Kraken onslaughts persist until their wrath is sated, their divine patrons are appeased, or their egos are placated by valuable offerings. Roll on or choose a result from the Kraken Attacks table to inspire what ruin a kraken might unleash.

Kraken lairs tend to be sunken temples, eldritch ritual sites, or primeval places of divine power. They might lie deep beneath bodies of fresh or salt water, and they often connect to labyrinths of flooded subterranean tunnels or networks of magical portals.

The region containing a kraken’s lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Ocean Tyrant.** The kraken exerts its dominance over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1 mile of the lair have the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition while in that area.

**Sea and Storms.** While in its lair, the kraken can cast [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619054-control-weather), requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.

**_Legendary Resistance (4/Day, or 5/Day in Lair)._** If the kraken fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Siege Monster._** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The kraken makes two Tentacle attacks and uses Fling, Lightning Strike, or Swallow.

**_Tentacle._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +17, reach 30 ft. _Hit:_ 24 (4d6 + 10) Bludgeoning damage. The target has the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition (escape DC 20) from one of ten tentacles, and it has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition until the grapple ends.

**_Fling._** The kraken throws a Large or smaller creature [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by it to a space it can see within 60 feet of itself that isn’t in the air. _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 25, the creature thrown and each creature in the destination space. _Failure:_ 18 (4d8) Bludgeoning damage, and the target has the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. _Success:_ Half damage only.

**_Lightning Strike._** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 23, one creature the kraken can see within 120 feet. _Failure:_ 33 (6d10) Lightning damage. _Success:_ Half damage.

**_Swallow._** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 25, one creature [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by the kraken (it can have up to four creatures swallowed at a time). _Failure:_ 23 (3d8 + 10) Piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is swallowed and no longer Grappled. A swallowed creature has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition, has [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 24 (7d6) Acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the kraken with the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. If the kraken dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the Restrained condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting Prone.

Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature’s turn, the kraken can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The kraken regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

**_Storm Bolt._** The kraken uses Lightning Strike.

**_Toxic Ink._** _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 23, each creature in a 15-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from the kraken while it is underwater. _Failure:_ The target has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) and [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) conditions until the end of the kraken’s next turn. The kraken then moves up to its Speed. _Failure or Success:_ The kraken can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.

A kraken dreams of casting its tentacles into the heavens and strangling that which birthed it, and when its dream exceeds its reach, it settles for the occasional passing ship.

An adventurer stumbles on a kuo-toa archpriest and servants of its strange gods

Kuo-toa have slimy, humanoid bodies and the heads of goggle-eyed deep-sea fish. They claim they once dominated whole worlds, their empires spanning land and sea under the blessings of piscine gods. The kuo-toa can’t say what disaster brought their glorious civilization to an end, but elves, humans, mind flayers, and the kuo-toan gods bear the brunt of their blame. From the lands and seas of the surface, the kuo-toa retreated into cavernous trenches and Underdark seas. In these hidden realms, kuo-toa brood over all they’ve lost and forgotten, nursing plots to avenge themselves for slights that might never have occurred.

Kuo-toa hate the civilizations of the surface and the Underdark, believing themselves to be victims of age-old slights and ongoing conspiracies. Kuo-toa undertake contrived plots to propel themselves to dominance, often kidnapping people to learn their secrets or making dubious sacrifices to bizarre gods. To facilitate such plots, kuo-toa try to capture creatures alive using nets or strange weapons. Drow, dwarves, and gnomes dwelling in the Underdark, as well as surface communities near submerged subterranean passages, are frequent targets for kuo-toa raids and other plots.

Kuo-toa frequently serve depraved masterminds such as aboleths and krakens. Such kuo-toa believe these powerful creatures are avatars of kuo-toan deities or gods in their own right. Kuo-toa might temporarily ally with other evil creatures, but these alliances shift as kuo-toa leaders interpret omens from their unpredictable deities.

When the Corpse Moon rises and the Chum-Tide washes in, up rise the Gogglers from their pits beneath the waves. Burbling and noisome they come, fishing night’s shores as we do dawn’s waves.

Lacking information about what their other gods look like, kuo-toa priests invent new forms for them, creating divine idols with whatever objects are at hand.

They came here from somewhere else and brought with them all the rank and dank of the sunless sea. No one knows what they want, and seems to me, neither do they.

Kuo-toa loot ruins and raid communities near their dwellings in the Underdark. Their shields are coated in sticky slime, which they use to disarm their foes, and they employ slimy nets to entrap victims. They usually strive to take their enemies alive and drag captives to their hidden lairs.

Most kuo-toa follow the orders of their more powerful leaders out of a combination of faith and fear. In rare cases, a kuo-toa might abandon its community to live as a hermit or wanderer. Such kuo-toa might know much about the Underdark, but they live in fear of the strange gods they forsook.

A kuo-toa whip and kuo-toa monitor lead a midnight raid

Kuo-toa monitors control the day-to-day life of weaker kuo-toa, directing their work and worship. They also train beasts or monsters in the kuo-toa’s service—such as [chuuls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194944-chuul) or [giant crabs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775818-giant-crab)—and command them in battle.
