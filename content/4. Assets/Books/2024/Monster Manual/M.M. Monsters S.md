A sahuagin baron and sahuagin priest lead sahuagin warriors on an aquatic raid

Sahuagin are fiendish terrors that prey on creatures above and below the water. Called “sea devils” by residents of coastal communities, sahuagin are ruthless raiders. They ransack ships, fishing villages, and undersea communities to slake their bloodthirst, claim treasure, and make sacrifices to their vicious deity—the sharklike god Sekolah.

Sahuagin constantly war on any peoples living near their territory. [Merfolk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-m#Merfolk) and other aquatic folk bear the brunt of these attacks, but sahuagin also hunt air-breathers who sail over or swim through the waters the sea devils claim. Sahuagin often attack alongside sharks, which they can telepathically command.

Sahuagin warriors are vicious combatants that savage their foes with webbed claws. Once sahuagin draw blood, they usually attack until either they or their foe is slain.

During times of great conflict, Sekolah blesses particularly ruthless sahuagin warriors with increased size and an additional pair of arms, transforming them into sahuagin barons. These boons elevate the recipients’ status among their kind, and they become champions or leaders.

A salamander inferno master drives its salamander and fire snake minions to burn all they encounter

Salamanders are serpentine denizens of the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofFire). They believe that flames expose the purest forms of all things and delight in burning and melting things, seeing fleeting beauty and striking nuances in blazes consuming different fuels—ancient forests, artistic masterpieces, or living creatures. To salamanders, those that can’t endure their flames are nothing but ashes in disguise. They harbor malice toward few creatures, but they consider creating remarkable flames more important than the pain and loss their fires cause.

Salamanders are typically content to dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire, creating strange, temporary art amid the flames. Some travel to other planes of existence and worlds to experience the flames of other realms or create conflagrations of unprecedented scale.

Juvenile salamanders emerge from burning hot, two-foot-diameter eggs. Called fire snakes, these serpentlike creatures slither through the Plane of Fire and other intensely hot places. After consuming the proper fuels and exposing themselves to fiery extremes, fire snakes grow into salamanders.

Most salamanders are arrogant yet curious, seeking to create artful blazes or burn that which has never been burned. They eagerly explain their work to strangers before trying to determine how the strangers burn. Salamanders radiate intense heat, which is conducted by their blazing weapons.

The salamanders of the Elemental Plane of Fire delight in meeting visitors from other realms. For them, every stranger is a potential addition to their fiery artistry. Don’t fall for their flattery, no matter how beautifully they say you’ll burn.

Spirits of vengeance bound to crude frames, scarecrows arise from folk magic, the prayers of desperate commoners, or possession by spirits that died with violent work left undone. Scarecrows might serve those who created them or might defend a place, family, or community from threats—whether physical or to their way of life.

Although scarecrows take their name from rural effigies, they might take varied patchwork forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Scarecrow Frames table to inspire a scarecrow’s appearance.

Shadow demons form when exceptionally wicked demons are destroyed and prevented from reconstituting their physical forms in the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss). This might occur due to divine intervention, when a demon is destroyed in the Abyss, or under more unusual circumstances. Shadow demons are the incorporeal remnants of these destroyed demons’ evil. They usually vaguely resemble their former shapes, but some take purposefully deceptive shapes. Many lurk in dark places or venture out only at night to hide their true forms from those they manipulate.

Shadow demons seek ways to regain their former might and take revenge on those who destroyed them. They often ingratiate themselves with more powerful demons or mortal spellcasters, bargaining with and coercing others into restoring them to power. Many try to claim or corrupt souls to restore their fiendish forms, while some shadow demons seek wicked relics or nexuses of profane magic. It typically takes shadow demons centuries to recover their demonic power, if they ever do.

Particularly powerful demons might return as multiple shadow demons after being defeated. These fiendish entities each think they’re the true manifestation of their past self and hunt one another to recover their power.

In rare cases, Fiends other than demons might adopt forms similar to shadow demons.

There are three rules to endings. First, good always wins. Second, evil always returns. Third, the first rule isn’t always true.

A shadow dragon lurks among haunted ruins, attended by shadows raised by its life-draining breath

Shadow dragons haunt forgotten, lightless places. While they might have once been other types of dragons, the influence of planar forces, negative energy, or sinister magic has stripped them of their former color or luster. In place of any former breath weapon, shadow dragons exhale caliginous gouts that saps life from everything it touches. Those slain by a shadow dragon’s breath rise as shades obedient to the shadow dragon’s will.

Shadow dragons typically dwell in the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe), particularly in areas with connections to the [Shadowfell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Shadowfell) or other tenebrous realms. In some cases, they might lurk in dark, corrupted reaches of the regions they preferred before transforming into shadow dragons. Overgrown swamps, sepulchral desert ruins, and ash-choked volcanoes make natural lairs for shadow dragons.

Like many other dragons, shadow dragons collect hoards. Their tastes tend to be morbid—collecting coins from ruined empires and their victims’ skulls.

Shambling mounds—also known as “shamblers”—embody the tenacity of the wilderness, seeking only to consume and grow. These masses of vegetation rise up to half again as tall as a human and possess thick limbs and a vague head. As they move through bogs and undergrowth, they ensnare creatures that come within reach. Shambling mounds bury those they catch within their own forms as compost.

Strange circumstances might give rise to shambling mounds, transforming vegetation into hulks with rudimentary cunning. Such conditions include strikes from magical lightning, nature defending itself, or druidic curses. Roll on or choose a result from the Shambling Mound Cultivation table to inspire a shambling mound’s origins and features.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-s#ShieldGuardian)Shield Guardian

Device-Controlled Magical Bodyguard

**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** None

An intimidating magical automaton, a shield guardian obeys its master’s commands and protects its master from danger. When such a guardian is created, the magic that animates it is intertwined with a bonded command amulet. Any creature that has a shield guardian’s command amulet can control that Construct and, in the case of magic-users, imbue it with a spell to unleash under predetermined circumstances. Yet a shield guardian’s primary goal is to protect its master. It escorts whoever bears its command amulet and intercedes between the bearer and any threat. Although it isn’t mindless, a shield guardian has no sense of self preservation and will sacrifice itself to protect its master.

Shield guardians are typically constructed of steel, stone, and wood in the shape of watchful soldiers. More fanciful designs exist, reflecting the tastes of their creators. Given their resilience, it’s common for shield guardians to eventually serve creatures other than their creators. A shield guardian’s command amulet might be passed down through a magic-using society or family for generations.

**CR** 7 (XP 2,900; PB +3)

Traits

**_Bound._** The guardian is magically bound to an amulet. While the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet’s wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet’s wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (round up) is transferred to the guardian.

**_Regeneration._** The guardian regains 10 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 Hit Point.

**_Spell Storing._** A spellcaster who wears the guardian’s amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of level 4 or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian while within 5 feet of it. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. Any previously stored spell is lost when a new spell is stored. The guardian can cast the spell stored with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no spell components and using the caster’s spellcasting ability. The stored spell is then lost.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The guardian makes two Fist attacks.

**_Fist._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +7, reach 10 ft. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) Bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) Force damage.

Reactions

**_Protection._** _Trigger:_ An attack roll hits the wearer of the guardian’s amulet while the wearer is within 5 feet of the guardian. _Response:_ The wearer gains a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack and possibly causing it to miss, until the start of the guardian’s next turn.

Dragons of Courage and Fairness

**Habitat:** Mountain, Urban; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Silver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency while remaining watchful against evil.

Silver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations and congeniality drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with artists, historians, knights, and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures.

Silver dragons take inspiration from legendary heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories, ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.

**Gentle Gusts.** Winds buoy creatures that fall within 1 mile of the lair. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.

**Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619054-control-weather), requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.

Adventurers face an onslaught from all manner of skeletons

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they’re the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

Skeletons are reanimated Humanoid bones bearing the equipment they had in life. They have rudimentary faculties and greater agility than zombies and similar shambling corpses. While they aren’t capable of creating plans of their own, they avoid obvious barriers and self-destructive situations.

Chaos-Spawned Hordes of Limbo

**Habitat:** Planar (Limbo); **Treasure:** Any

Néstor Ossandón leal[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/19-016.slaad.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/19-016.slaad.png)

A red slaad and blue slaad, along  
with several slaad tadpoles, burst  
from a portal on the plane of Limbo

Unpredictable slaadi devour and multiply across the Ever-Changing Chaos of [Limbo](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Limbo). These toad-like, extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren’t inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate through supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other creatures.

Slaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. [Blue](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194929-blue-slaad) and [red slaadi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195180-red-slaad) rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of [green slaadi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195058-green-slaad). More powerful slaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the multiverse.

Slaad Control Gems

A slaad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical control gem embedded in its head. If a creature claims the gem, the slaad has the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition and obeys the gem’s bearer. The slaad ceases to be Charmed if it is harmed by the gem’s bearer or the bearer’s allies or if the gem is returned to the slaad. A [Greater Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell cast on a slaad destroys the gem, and the slaad ceases to be Charmed. One can obtain a slaad’s control gem using a [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) or [Imprisonment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619175-imprisonment) spell. If the slaad fails its saving throw against _Imprisonment_, the caster gains the gem, and the slaad isn’t imprisoned. An [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) slaad’s control gem can be removed by spending 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. Failing this check deals 22 (4d10) Piercing damage to the slaad.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-s#SlaadTadpole)Slaad Tadpole

Slaad tadpoles are ravenous, newborn slaadi. They hatch from eggs implanted into living hosts by red slaadi, but they also appear in great numbers in Limbo and other chaotic realms. Under most conditions, a slaad tadpole transforms into a blue slaad—or a green slaad if its host was able to cast spells of level 3 or higher—within 2d12 hours of hatching.

When they encounter non-slaadi, red slaadi seek to play with, telepathically converse with, or devour the other creatures. These whims change from moment to moment.

Removing the curse destroys the egg.

Over 2d4 × 10 days, the egg gestates.

Almost as numerous as red slaadi, blue slaadi are muscular brutes with vicious blades extending from the backs of their claws. These claws carry a magical curse called chaos phage, which can transform victims into red or green slaadi. Blue slaadi accompany red slaadi and behave similarly.

Green slaadi come into being when the propagation methods of red or blue slaadi affect certain creatures capable of casting spells of level 3 or higher. Green slaadi are more intelligent than their blue and red brethren and often direct their kin to portals where gray slaadi have identified Humanoid communities ripe for invasion.

Angelic Protector of the Multiverse

**Habitat:** Planar (Upper Planes); **Treasure:** Any

Solars stand as the final line of defense between unspeakable evils and the order of the multiverse. They are the servants of just deities and ageless forces of good. Their interests span the planes, but they rarely intervene in conflicts on the worlds of the Material Plane. When they act, they lead vast angelic hosts and wield holy weapons capable of laying low the wickedest Fiends.

Solars can resurrect the dead and often use that power to enlist mortal aid. They bestow grand, new purposes on those they return to life. Solars don’t enforce these destinies, but they trust in the potential of mortals to achieve great things.

Invoking mysterious rites involving four beholder eyestalks, a spellcaster can mold aberrant dreams into a beholder-like guardian. Called a spectator, the being summoned by such a ritual resembles a [beholder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194923-beholder) with five magical eyes—a central eye and four on stalks arrayed around the crown of the creature’s spherical body.

A spectator serves its conjurer for 101 years by guarding something of the spellcaster’s choice—typically a treasure or location. The spectator is a reliable guardian and allows only its summoner access to what it protects. A spectator might converse with other creatures, openly discussing its orders and the magic-user who conjured it, but it has no ambitions of its own and won’t abandon its post. Should an intruder ignore its warnings, a spectator attempts to drive away the intruder with its magical eye rays.

At the end of its service, a spectator might discorporate back into nothingness or wander away, seeking to learn more of the multiverse.

A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time a unique idea is conceived on the Material Plane. Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular type of story or field of study, and it learns all it can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its forehead that suggests the type of knowledge that fascinates it. Sometimes, a sphinx of wonder forms a bond with a mortal scholar and aids them in their research.

Sphinxes of secrets are commonly associated with a site of great magic or learning. These immortal beings often outlive such locations, though, and might protect a site’s ruins as they continue their own studies. Sphinxes of secrets fiercely guard their dwellings and research.

Sphinxes typically dwell in places that hold great knowledge or prophetic magic.

The region containing a sphinx of lore’s or sphinx of valor’s lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Distant Sight.** While in its lair, the sphinx can cast [Clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618972-clairvoyance), requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When cast this way, the spell’s range is 1 mile.

**Infusion of Knowledge.** Whenever the sphinx or one of its allies takes a [Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action while within 1 mile of the lair, it adds 1d6 to any ability check it makes for that action.

If the sphinx dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

Spirit nagas loathe the world and all creatures. Possessing perfect memories, these venomous, cobra-like creatures recall every slight committed against them during their immortal existences. In their dank, joyless lairs, they create vicious plots to avenge themselves against even petty offenses.

Spirit nagas seek to claim what they believe they deserve. Their schemes often involve poisons, vile spells, cursed objects, or magical compulsions, eventually making them wellsprings of diabolical knowledge and evil inspiration. Other villains often seek out spirit nagas as advisers and allies. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Naga Grievances table to inspire what motivates a spirit naga’s schemes.

Elusive Defender of Fey Realms

**Habitat:** Forest, Planar (Feywild); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Sprites dwell in mystical forests touched by the magic of the Feywild, living peacefully with most other Fey and friends of nature. These foot-tall spirits of nature resemble elves with exaggerated, whimsical features and gossamer wings.

Sprites can sense the innate goodness or wickedness of other creatures. Those that enter their realms with good intentions might be treated to tiny feasts and celebrations. The wicked face nasty tricks and bold ambushes at the hands of invisible sprite defenders. These woodland guardians enchant the arrows of their tiny bows with charming magic that can pierce the heart of the fiercest foe.

The tree had a wee village nestled in its boughs, I swear. Next thing I knew, I was lyin’ face-down in the dirt. My head was full of stars, an’ when I stood up an’ looked around, both the tree an’ the wee village were gone.

—Tale of Haravak the Ranger

Sprites oppose any creatures that seek to harm places of natural magic and beauty. This can put them into conflict with would-be settlers, monsters like ettercaps, and despoilers such as goblinoids and hags. They frequently aid other good creatures of the forest, including treants and unicorns, in defending their homes.

Giant of the Earth

**Habitat:** Mountain, Underdark; **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Robson Michel[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/19-030.stone-giants.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/19-030.stone-giants.png)

In cavernous depths and amid mountain canyons, stone giants contemplate the strength and persistence of the earth. Stone giants have rugged features and skin with patterns and hues similar to the rock common near their homes. This makes them adept at blending in with their stony surroundings despite their size.

Stone giants rarely interfere in the affairs of other creatures, whether their smaller neighbors or other Giants. Most are slow to act, preferring to weather hardships or wait out perilous times. When roused to action—particularly when sites of ancient wonder or their homes are threatened—stone giants can unleash the might of mountains and crush foes with the force of an avalanche.

Stone giants often ponder the mysteries of natural wonders, such as mountain spires, crystal formations, or mystical petroglyphs. Some know much about the magic and secret messages hidden within the earth. Those who confine themselves to the Underdark often regard the surface world and its inhabitants as dreams imagined into being by slumbering primordials, strange gods, or other entities.

Stone golems take varied forms, such as weathered carvings of ancient deities, lifelike sculptures of heroes, or any other shape their makers imagine.

Life-Draining Seducer

**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes), Urban; **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables)

Succubi prey on mortals physically and exploit their waking desires. They relish corrupting virtuous souls and the pain an individual’s downfall can cause. Once their targets are at their lowest, succubi slay their victims with their essence-draining kiss.

Through fiendish rites, succubi can transform into incubi to manipulate their prey in dreams as well as the waking world. They can also change shape to torment their victims. These tempters can dominate Humanoids, but they usually do so to reinforce their manipulations or defend themselves rather than controlling others outright. Roll on or choose a result from the Succubus Temptations table to inspire how a succubus toys with its victims.
