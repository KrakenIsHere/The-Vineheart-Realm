Archmages have mastered incredible magical power. While some use their magic to protect the world, others become tyrants or pursue forbidden secrets. Many archmages retain magical servants and collect magic items and occult lore.

Have you gazed on the Runes of Chaos, held the Death Moon Orb in your trembling hands, entered the Devouring Portal and walked the Paths of the Doomed, or sat at the left hand of Szass Tam during the Ritual of Twin Burnings? No? Then speak not to me of wizards. Speak not to me of Thay.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-m#Magmin)Magmin

Reckless Elemental Arsonist

**Habitat:** Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire); **Treasure:** None

Hinchel Or[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-002.magmin.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-002.magmin.png)

Magmins divide all things into two categories: things that are on fire and things that should be on fire. With bodies of flame and magmatic rock, these halfling-size creatures delight in setting fires. They do so not out of malice but out of enthusiasm for primal fire. They don’t consider that objects have value beyond kindling or that creatures can be harmed by flames. If such concepts are explained to them, they find the ideas difficult to grasp and don’t remember them for long. Rather, they relish every opportunity to set flammable things alight, delighting in igniting paper, wooden structures, and explosives. Magmins are dangerous even in death, since they explode when they’re destroyed, their flames igniting combustible materials nearby.

Magmins might be conjured by magic-users to harry foes or might escape the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofFire) through portals or rifts that lead to other realms. They’re attracted to places of intense heat, such as volcanoes and rivers of magma. If they can’t find such favored conditions, magmins eagerly burn structures or start wildfires to entertain themselves.

Demons of Panic and Frenzy

The lowest form of demons, manes appear when truly loathsome souls are condemned to the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss). These misshapen demons have distorted features and bodies that crawl with Abyssal parasites. Overwhelmed by demonic urges and constant terror, manes know only shock and frenzied outbursts.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-m#ManesMonster)Manes

Manes lash out at creatures that appear weaker than themselves—or that react to them with fear—and strive to avoid more powerful demons. When manes escape from the Abyss, they go on reckless rampages and inflict as much harm as possible.

With lionlike claws, leathery wings, and broad jaws filled with rows of sharp teeth, manticores ambush travelers from above and devour them. Manticores crave the taste of humans, but lacking their favored prey, they eagerly consume other peoples and livestock.

Manticores have tails bristling with detachable spikes. These monsters launch their tail spikes at their prey, skewering those on the ground or knocking flying creatures from the air.

Despite their ravenous tendencies, manticores enjoy speaking with those they’re about to devour. Sometimes they make agreements with their prey. Roll on or choose a result from the Manticore Negotiations table to inspire what a manticore might offer in exchange for a more tempting meal.

Genie of the Water

**Habitat:** Coastal, Planar (Elemental Plane of Water), Underwater; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Michael Broussard[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-005.marid.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-005.marid.png)

Marids surge with the power of the seas, using it to manipulate the waves or create water. These genies typically dwell in or near bodies of water. While gentle marids make homes amid springs, oases, and serene pools, tempestuous marids inhabit sea stacks, whirlpools, and treacherous coasts. Marids vary in appearance, their bodies reflecting the colors of the waves while distinctive fins and scales accent their features. Marids lend their powers and knowledge of the seas to those who defend the marids’ watery realms or who offer them pleasing gifts. Marids appreciate rare aquatic treasures, such as colorful pearls, shell instruments, or delicacies from distant seas.

Marids hail from the [Elemental Plane of Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofWater), where they live in wondrous homes drifting amid the endless ocean. Among these is the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls—a coral sphere studded with dozens of domed theaters and libraries—and the air-filled, cosmopolitan City of Glass.

Snake-Haired Recluse with a Petrifying Gaze

**Habitat:** Desert; **Treasure:** Any

With their hair of living snakes and their infamous petrifying gazes, medusas are hubristic creatures that inhabit sites of fallen glory. They often dwell beyond the fringes of civilization or travel in disguise, leaving trails of petrified victims. Some medusas dominate groups of monsters or criminals, controlling them with threats of petrified doom, while others recruit servants that are immune to being petrified, such as [gargoyles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195003-gargoyle) and [gorgons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195052-gorgon).

Medusas are born or created through preternatural circumstances. Roll on or choose a result from the Medusa Fates table to inspire what led to a medusa’s creation.

Malicious Elemental Hooligans

**Habitat:** Planar (Elemental Planes); **Treasure:** None

Andrew Mar[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-008.mephits.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/13-008.mephits.png)

Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or overblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users.

Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic.

Ogreish Undersea Abductor

**Habitat:** Coastal, Underwater; **Treasure:** Any

Vicious aquatic hunters, merrow combine the features of ogres with those of primeval, predatory fish. They lurk in coastal waters, hoping to snare unsuspecting prey by bursting from the water and grabbing their quarry or by skewering victims with deadly harpoons. These hunters then drag land dwellers back to dismal undersea lairs. Merrow often keep prisoners in their larders as future meals.

Merrow raid coastal settlements and merfolk communities to steal weapons and treasure. This leads to conflicts between merfolk and merrow, but it also provokes misunderstandings with surface dwellers who blame merfolk for merrow attacks.

Sages trace merrows’ origins to aquatic ogres, depraved merfolk, and worse. Such broad theories reveal little about these monsters but overmuch of the dread lurking beyond our certain shores.

**Habitat:** Planar (Gehenna); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Mezzoloths are insectile yugoloths that seek power and souls in the service of fiendish lords. These greedy, violent yugoloths are more direct than most of their scheming brethren, but what they lack in guile they make up for in persistence and numbers.

Mezzoloths typically form mercenary bands with others of their kind. These forces serve more powerful yugoloths, other fiends, sinister mages, or anyone who provides them with tempting rewards. Mezzoloths obediently adhere to the bargains they strike, potentially serving their patrons for centuries, but once those terms expire, yesterday’s client could become today’s target. Roll on or choose a result from the Mezzoloth Payments table to inspire a mezzoloth’s price for its services.

In their natural forms, mimics are little more than roaming stomachs, their blobby bodies covered with alien eyes and teeth. They can alter their color, texture, and dimensions to duplicate inanimate objects of their approximate size. Mimics use their disguises as both camouflage and bait. Once victims draw close, mimics strike, lashing out with their sticky pseudopods and toothy mouths. After consuming victims, mimics usually relocate, change form, and await their next meal.

Scattered survivors of a world-ruining, multiversal empire, mind flayers lurk in secret conclaves hidden deep within Material Plane worlds. Within their alien sanctuaries, these wicked masterminds—also known as illithids—reshape the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) and its inhabitants to serve their unfathomable whims. Mind flayers are feared for their psionic powers, which allow them to stun and control other creatures, and for their horrific method of feeding: using their four slimy tentacles to extract the brains of their victims.

Mind flayers are infamous plotters and manipulators, concocting plans that reach beyond their subterranean realms. Aside from using their psionic powers to control others, mind flayers often experiment with their own bizarre life cycles, implanting other creatures with illithid young to create unnatural servants. Creatures such as [grimlocks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195063-grimlock) and [intellect devourers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195088-intellect-devourer) result from mind flayers’ biological tampering, while other Underdark-dwelling monsters—including [kuo-toa](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195101-kuo-toa), [quaggoths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195176-quaggoth), and [troglodytes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195239-troglodyte)—often serve illithid masters. [Githyanki](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-g#Githyanki) and [githzerai](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-g#Githzerai) have a long adversarial history with mind flayers and bear the scars of illithid manipulation.

**_Arcane Tentacles._** _Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:_ +9, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft. _Hit:_ 27 (4d10 + 5) Psychic damage, and the mind flayer can teleport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space the mind flayer can see on a surface or liquid large enough to support the target.

[Baphomet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layer600TheEndlessMaze), Demon Lord of Beasts, claims to have created minotaurs and demands their worship. While most minotaurs live free of the demon lord’s bonds, those that serve him become minotaurs of Baphomet. These brutes resemble the hulking, horned demon lord more than others of their kind, and they wreak havoc in that foul immortal’s name. Rarely, non-minotaurs cursed by magic-users or spiteful deities might transform into these monsters.

Minotaurs of Baphomet often dwell in mazes, leading their allies to hidden destinations and stalking trespassers. Roll on or choose a result from the Minotaur Mazes table to inspire the shape of a minotaur’s dwelling.

Mechanized Caretakers of Multiversal Law

**Habitat:** Planar (Mechanus); **Treasure:** None

Beings of magic and machinery, modrons embody absolute law. These inhabitants of the clockwork plane of [Mechanus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Mechanus) tend to the incredible mechanisms of their orderly home and oppose chaotic forces across the multiverse.

Modrons are parts of a vast hierarchy, spanning from quirky monodrones to the leader of their kind, the godlike Primus. Every modron carries out tasks assigned to it by higher-ranking modrons, doing so without question. Generally, modrons communicate only with other modrons of their own rank or the ranks immediately above and below them. Those more than one rank away tend to be either too advanced or too simple for them to understand.

Modrons excel at tasks that require patience and precision, but they have little understanding of nonliteral concepts such as art or humor. They have no egos; they have only their work and the certainty that multiversal law depends on their efficacy.

In rare cases, a modron goes rogue and develops its own will. In these cases, other modrons are sent to recover or destroy their malfunctioning kin.

The guide swore “beep boop” meant “hello, friend.” I don’t know why they’re after us!

Deathless Ancients with Ageless Ambitions

**Habitat:** Desert, Swamp; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Mysterious rites and mighty faith can tie spirits to their corpses, binding them to their remains for all time. Should their resting places be violated, these beings, known as mummies, reanimate their deteriorating bodies to restore the sanctity of their tombs and punish those who disturbed their rest.

Mummies pursue those who offend them, typically mortals who desecrate their resting places, steal their burial treasures, or defile sites tied to their faith. With undying rage, these ancient corpses go to extreme lengths to avenge themselves and restore what they need to find peace.

A mummy might look frail, but its body possesses supernatural strength, and its gaze can strike fear in the bravest hearts. Those who escape a mummy’s grasp might find themselves subject to a terrible curse. Victims of a mummy’s curse gradually wither, their bodies rotting away until they’re reduced to dust. This curse can be healed only by the [Remove Curse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618943-remove-curse) spell or similar magic.

Those desperate to escape death sometimes make terrible bargains with wicked deities. Devoting their hearts to evil forces, these villains gain power over death and a cursed immortality that binds their minds and spirits within a desiccated corpse. Freed from mortal concerns, these mummy lords pursue their obsessions across ages.

Most mummy lords linger amid the ruins of ancient palaces or temples where they once held sway. Their age-old faith and ties to deathly forces grant them fearful magic, which they use to sow ruin and animate undead servants.

A mummy lord’s heart embodies the pact that grants it immortality. Rather than bearing its heart within its corpse, a mummy lord removes and hides this accursed organ. As long as its heart isn’t destroyed by fire, a mummy lord can return to unlife no matter what doom it meets.

Mummy lords are usually consumed by ageless plots. Roll on or choose a result from the Mummy Lord Plots table to determine a mummy lord’s ancient agenda.

Mummy lords typically lurk in the ruins of places they dwelled in life. Such sites have forbidding reputations, or they might be lost and forgotten.

The region containing a mummy lord’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Cursed Fate.** Whenever a creature other than the mummy or one of its allies casts a Divination spell while within 1 mile of the lair, the creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast the spell is wasted, but any resources used to cast it aren’t expended.

**Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have Disadvantage on Death Saving Throws.

If the mummy lord is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the mummy lord gains a new body (see its Undead Restoration trait).

Myconids tend to the fungi in their hidden gardens, whether  
mysterious mushrooms or their own community members

Myconids dwell in remote [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) reaches overgrown with molds and mushrooms. These ambulatory fungal creatures tend to their sanctuaries and avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of other creatures. They use specialized spores to communicate, to alert one another to danger, and to defend themselves. When myconids encounter others beings, they use mind-linking spores to allow nearby creatures to telepathically share thoughts. Nevertheless, myconids’ goals remain mysterious to most non-fungal creatures.
