Aarakocra are birdlike folk who soar the skies of countless worlds and the endless expanses of the [Elemental Plane of Air](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofAir). They often resemble avians common to the lands where they dwell; some resemble hawks or condors, while others appear similar to hummingbirds or archaeopteryxes. In many lands, aarakocra tell of their ancient heroics resisting the wicked Queen of Chaos alongside the mysterious Wind Dukes of Aaqa.

A gnome cultist consults an all-knowing aboleth

In aquatic abysses, aboleths dream of dead empires and orchestrate plots that unfold across ages. These elusive, amphibious immortals physically and mentally overwhelm their victims and transform creatures with a slimy, aberrant infection, reshaping other beings to serve them beneath the waves.

Aboleths possess terrifying intellects and have alien mindsets. These creatures possess perfect memories of proto-worlds and incomprehensible dominions from the multiverse’s earliest eons. Their secrets are innumerable and unfathomable. Aboleths lurk in places awash in primordial mysteries: the ruins of aquatic empires, hidden magical nexuses, or weak places between planes of existence. In these lairs, aboleths dream of epochs past, collect throngs of psychically dominated servants, consume the minds of unwitting victims, and prepare for their return to power.

Aboleths’ alien goals and methods are often mysterious to other creatures. Roll on or choose a result from the Aboleth Schemes table to inspire an aboleth’s schemes.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-a#AbolethSchemes)Aboleth Schemes
|1d6|The Aboleth Seeks To...|
|---|---|
|1|Accomplish incomprehensible plans that lead it to act in seemingly random ways.|
|2|Learn more of the world by kidnapping people and consuming their minds.|
|3|Manipulate innocents into worshiping it as a god by using its telepathy from hiding.|
|4|Open a gate to the distant past or future, releasing an invasion from another time.|
|5|Rouse a dragon turtle, a kraken, or another sea monster to flood a coastal city.|
|6|Trick treasure hunters into recovering relics from its long-fallen empire.|

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-a#AbolethLairs)Aboleth Lairs

Aboleths usually dwell in submerged ruins and caverns. They keep air-filled spaces for their terrestrial servants and to hold treasures that would be damaged by water.

The region containing an aboleth’s lair is warped by it, creating the following effects:

**Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Creatures other than the aboleth and its allies that drink such water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 hour.

**Psionic Projection.** While in its lair, the aboleth can cast [Project Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618903-project-image), requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16). When casting the spell this way, the spell’s range is 1 mile, and the aboleth can use its telepathy as if it were in the illusion’s space.

If the aboleth dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

“The lies we call reason are fragile things, vulnerable and raw on the shores of eons. But in the dream-vaults of dread ancients roil seas of terrifying truth. Our age is an island, and the ebb of primordial tides avows the Stygian wave.”

Traits

**_Amphibious._** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**_Eldritch Restoration._** If destroyed, the aboleth gains a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen by the DM.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair)._** If the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Mucus Cloud._** While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by mucus. _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 14, each creature in a 5-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. _Failure:_ The target is [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses). Until the curse ends, the target’s skin becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water, and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.

While the cursed creature is outside a body of water, the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin before those minutes have passed.

**_Probing Telepathy._** If a creature the aboleth can see communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind if available.

**_Tentacle._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +9, reach 15 ft. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition (escape DC 14) from one of four tentacles.

**_Consume Memories._** _Intelligence Saving Throw:_ DC 16, one creature within 30 feet that is [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by the aboleth. _Failure:_ 10 (3d6) Psychic damage. _Success:_ Half damage. _Failure or Success:_ The aboleth gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.

**_Dominate Mind (2/Day)._** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet. _Failure:_ The target has the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition until the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within 60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Energetic spirits from the [Elemental Plane of Air](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofAir), air elementals gather clouds and winds into ever-changing bodies with indistinct limbs and vague features. Beyond their home plane, these elementals might serve magic-users who conjure them, or they might congregate around nexuses of unbridled planar energy, such as wind-scoured mountain peaks or endless storms. In battle, air elementals batter enemies with powerful gusts or transform into whirlwinds to fling away foes.

Air elementals often have distinctive compositions. Roll on or choose a result from the Air Elemental Compositions table to inspire the elemental’s appearance.

Animal lords are the immortal spirits of legendary animals. They serve as the divine protectors of animals of their kind, and they appear as hybrids of humanoids and the animals they defend. They frequently change into giant, idealized versions of the animals they’re associated with—albeit with glowing eyes. When contending with people, they sometimes appear as humanlike beings with subtle, animal-like features. No matter their appearance, animal lords exhibit the instincts and predilections of the animals they represent, tempered by their intellect and experience.

Most animal lords make their homes in the Beastlands, but they occasionally journey to the Feywild or other idyllic realms. They rarely travel to the Material Plane, making exceptions only when a world faces environmental disaster or droves of animals are otherwise in jeopardy.

Valera Lutfullina[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-004.animal-lords.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-004.animal-lords.png)

Among the best-known animal lords are those that represent cats, hawks, lizards, and wolves, but animal lords exist for beasts of all types. Some animal lords even embody creatures that are rare or extinct on Material Plane worlds, like megafauna or dinosaurs. Using their divine might, animal lords can summon spectral animals, channel spiritual energy, and exhibit powers associated with one of three broad groups: foragers, hunters, or sages. These powers are tied to an animal lord’s personality and traits associated with the creature it resembles. Roll on or choose results from the relevant Animal Lord Appearances table to inspire what creature an animal lord resembles.

Mundane Objects Come to Life

**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** None

Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out.

Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item.

|1d10|The Object Was Animated By...|
|---|---|
|1|A Celestial or Fiend using the object to protect or torment a mortal.|
|2|A combination of magic and technology, such as alchemy or alien science.|
|3|The essence of someone transformed by a supernatural trickster.|
|4|Fey as part of their games or wiles.|
|5|Happenstance, with the item gaining a semblance of life after a hundred years of use.|
|6|A magic-user in need of a guardian or servant.|

Animated suits of armor might move with steady deliberateness or awkward gaits. They’re often constructed from plate armor, making them easy to mistake for soldiers or helmed horrors. Other types of armor or even metal statuary might also become animated armor.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-a#Ankheg)Ankheg

Burrowing Insectile Predator

**Habitat:** Forest, Grassland; **Treasure:** None

Oversize insects, ankhegs burrow close to the surface, creating sprawling underground labyrinths. From these tunnels, they burst forth to dissolve and devour smaller creatures using their acid-dripping mandibles and sprays of digestive enzymes.

Domenico Cava[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-006.ankheg.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-006.ankheg.png)

Ankhegs are the bane of farmers whose grazing livestock are easy prey for these monsters. Many ankhegs hunt alone, but those in places with ample food might collect in nests of several dozen and threaten whole towns. Ankheg nests can be challenging to wipe out unless the monsters’ tunnels are cleared out and their eggs destroyed.

Ankheg tunnels are roughly cylindrical and are often littered with the remains of ankhegs’ meals and subterranean treasures. Roll on or choose a result from the Ankheg Tunnel Discoveries table to inspire what might be found in an ankheg’s tunnel.

Though they feed on things under the soil, ankhegs prefer live meat—your cattle, your dogs, or you.

**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

While all yugoloths are fiendish manifestations of wickedness and greed, arcanaloths bend their considerable intellects toward hoarding and exploiting secrets. They then deploy these secrets to ensnare countless victims and lesser villains, beguiling foes with false promises and powerful magic.

Arcanaloths possess considerable spellcasting prowess and frequently disguise themselves with magic. While they prefer to let magical servants or other yugoloths do their fighting for them, arcanaloths can defend themselves with arcane might, banishing opponents into the pages of their magic tomes.

**_Magic Resistance._** The arcanaloth has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Soul Tome._** The arcanaloth has a magic tome. While holding or carrying the tome, the arcanaloth can use its Banishing Claw action.

The tome has AC 17; HP 35; and Immunity to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage. The tome regains all its Hit Points at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 Hit Points or when the arcanaloth dies. If the tome is destroyed, the arcanaloth can create a new one when it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The arcanaloth makes three Fiendish Burst attacks. It can replace one attack with a Banishing Claw attack.

**_Fiendish Burst._** _Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:_ +9, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft. _Hit:_ 31 (4d12 + 5) Necrotic damage.

**_Banishing Claw (Requires Soul Tome)._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +9, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 10 (2d4 + 5) Slashing damage plus 19 (3d12) Psychic damage. If the target is a creature, it is subjected to the following effect. _Charisma Saving Throw:_ DC 17. _Failure:_ The target is trapped in a demiplane inside the Soul Tome. While trapped there, the target has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, escaping the tome on a success. When the target escapes, it appears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

If the target fails three of these saves while in the demiplane, it becomes bound to the tome and can escape only if the tome is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

**_Spellcasting._** The arcanaloth casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At Will:** [Alter Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618846-alter-self), [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify), [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand), [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618893-prestidigitation)

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-a#Archhag)Arch-hag

Hag of Forbidden Secrets and Magical Malice

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Dario Jelusic[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-008.arch-hags.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/01-008.arch-hags.png)

Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets and strike magical bargains, altering fate to indulge their fickle whims. These timeless schemers pursue the secrets of the multiverse and work strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable goals.

Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and greedy, with bizarre fascinations and affectations. Nevertheless, they often make deals to further their plots. These hags are fonts of secret knowledge, particularly lore regarding forbidden magic and multiversal secrets. They might share their knowledge, but their secrets always have a price. In trade for their secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar errands, valuable magic items, or preternatural currency, like one’s memories, a year of one’s life, or the ability to cry.

Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to fight, they unleash dangerous magic, such as spectral claws, arcing lightning, and mind-bending spells. An arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding the spellcasters’ incantations and forcing the spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean. Even if an arch-hag is brought low, its preparations allow it to magically slip away and begin plotting its revenge.

Every arch-hag has a unique weakness tied to a fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something that embodies the antithesis of the hag’s magic. A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability secret. Although an arch-hag isn’t physically harmed by its weakness, it can be destroyed only while its weakness is nearby. Roll on or choose a result from the Arch-hag Anathemas table to inspire an arch-hag’s weakness.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-a#ArchhagLairs)Arch-hag Lairs

Each arch-hag creates a magical home, such as a hidden demiplane, a mansion atop a storm cloud, or—in the case of the arch-hag [Baba Yaga](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#BabaYaga)—a hut atop giant chicken legs. The interiors of these lairs frequently change or exhibit bewildering features.

The region containing an arch-hag’s lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Lapsus Linguae.** Creatures (excluding the hag and its allies) within 1 mile of the lair subtract 1d10 from any ability checks they make when they take the [Influence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InfluenceAction) action.

**Meddlesome Magic.** Whenever a creature other than the hag or its allies finishes a Long Rest while within 1 mile of the lair, the next time that creature casts a spell using a spell slot, it also casts [Confusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619043-confusion) centered on itself. The spell uses the creature’s spellcasting ability and doesn’t require [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration).

If the arch-hag is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

Heh! People who know too much grow old before their time. Ask me your questions, but be certain that every secret has its cost.

—Baba Yaga, Mother of Witches

Traits

**_Coven Magic._** While within 30 feet of at least two hag allies, the hag can cast one of the following spells, requiring no Material components, using the spell’s normal casting time, and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19): [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury), [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar), [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify), [Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619002-locate-object), [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619007-scrying), or [Unseen Servant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619209-unseen-servant). The hag must finish a Long Rest before using this trait to cast that spell again.

**_Legendary Resistance (4/Day, or 5/Day in Lair)._** If the hag fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** The hag has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Spiteful Escape._** When the hag drops to 0 Hit Points, it dies only if it is within 30 feet of its anathema (a thing the DM chooses as the hag’s most hated thing). Otherwise, the hag drops to 1 Hit Point and teleports to a harmless demiplane, and it can’t return to the plane it left for 2d6 days. When the hag teleports away, each creature within 60 feet of the space it left is [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses). Until the curse ends, a creature has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws, and the hag knows its location anywhere in the multiverse.

Actions

**_Spectral Claw._** _Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:_ +14, reach 10 ft. or range 60 ft. _Hit:_ 17 (3d6 + 7) Force damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

**_Crackling Wave._** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 22, each creature in a 60-foot [Cone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect). _Failure:_ 32 (5d12) Lightning damage. _Success:_ Half damage. _Failure or Success:_ The target is [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses) until the end of the hag’s next turn. The target can’t take Reactions until the curse ends.

**_Spellcasting._** The hag casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

Bonus Actions

Reactions

**_Tongue Twister._** The hag casts [Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell) in response to that spell’s trigger, using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting. If the target fails its saving throw, it is [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses) until the end of its next turn. Until the curse ends, the target can’t cast spells with a Verbal component, and when it speaks, it says the opposite of what it means.

Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature’s turn, the hag can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The hag regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

**_Hag’s Swipe._** The hag makes one Spectral Claw attack.

**_Malicious Magic._** The hag uses Spellcasting to cast [Dimension Door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619100-dimension-door) or [Hypnotic Pattern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619168-hypnotic-pattern). The hag can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.

Assassins are professional killers skilled at stealthily approaching their victims and striking unseen. Most assassins kill for a reason, perhaps hiring themselves out to wealthy patrons or slaying for an unscrupulous cause. They use poisons and other deadly tools, and they might carry equipment to help them break into secure areas or avoid capture.

Many assassins adhere to a professional code or exhibit some signature quirk. Roll on or choose a result from the Assassin Modus Operandi table to inspire an assassin’s distinctive habits.

Magic can invest plants with mobility, sapience, and even a voice. Spells such as [Awaken](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618897-awaken) or the influence of other planes of existence might bring mundane vegetation to life, while other remarkable plants might naturally have these features.

Just because we protect the forest doesn’t mean it’s defenseless.

Awakened shrubs can be any sort of small plant, from forest bushes to clustered flowers. They often appear near awakened trees or in regions imbued with primal magic. Some have whimsical appearances or foliage resembling rudimentary facial features, while others look like animate topiary creatures.

Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods, making them easy to mistake for normal plants, while others patrol regions of natural power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life by influences from the Feywild, which make them colorful and endlessly blooming, or by Shadowfell energy, which covers them with grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless.

Flightless Avian Predators

**Habitat:** Arctic, Grassland, Hill; **Treasure:** None

Axe beaks are flightless, birdlike creatures with distinctive axe-shaped beaks. Swift predators, they chase down prey and use their beaks to hack through foliage protecting their quarry. Axe beaks live in varied environments. Colorfully plumed axe beaks race across tropical plains, while axe beaks with snowy feathers hunt the tundra.

Axe beaks are difficult to train, but those hatched and raised in captivity can become reliable mounts.

The thing’s got an axe for a face and a giant, angry rooster for everything else—of course I want to ride it!

Alone or in small groups, axe beaks stalk prey to feed their flocks. When working together, axe beaks use rudimentary tactics, with some distracting threats while others strike vulnerable targets or rush young axe beaks to safety.
