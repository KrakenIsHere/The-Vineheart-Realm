## Ultroloth

Yugoloth of Conspiracy and Control

**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

With uncanny patience and fiendish cunning, ultroloths manipulate mortals and their fellow yugoloths alike, seeking to hoard power and spread suffering. These sinister masterminds often work with other yugoloths, but they might compel nearly any creature into their service. If coercion doesn’t work, ultroloths use their eerie eyes and innate magic to hypnotize or charm targets.

Ultroloths strive to achieve planes-spanning plots. Roll on or choose a result from the Ultroloth Conspiracies table to inspire such villainy.

Burrowing Brute from Below

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Lumbering, carapace-armored bipeds, umber hulks burrow through the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe), feeding on anything they can crush in their mighty mandibles. These tenacious hunters sense movement through the surrounding earth, then burst through cavern walls to surprise their prey. Those ambushed by umber hulks risk meeting the gaze of the monsters’ eerie, multifaceted eyes, which can cause others to act irrationally and even lash out at their allies.

Umber hulks typically lurk in tunnels they’ve burrowed alongside other passages. When they detect creatures moving, they burst through the rock walls between the passages to attack. While these monsters can communicate with one other, they usually hunt alone and avoid each other’s territories. Umber hulks focus on finding food and crushing intruders. They have little interest in allying with other creatures, but manipulative inhabitants of the Underdark, such as [beholders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194923-beholder) and [mind flayers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer), sometimes compel umber hulks to serve them.

**Habitat:** Forest, Planar (Feywild); **Treasure:** Any

Unicorns are majestic defenders of forests. They are revered by many Fey and other forest dwellers, and they do whatever they can to ensure the peace and health of those who shelter in their wooded realms.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-u#UnicornLairs)Unicorn Lairs

Unicorns dwell in unspoiled forests, particularly where benevolent Fey creatures live.

The region containing a unicorn’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Obscuring Foliage.** The unicorn and its allies have Advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks while within 1 mile of the lair.

**Positive Energy.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains Hit Points from a spell, it regains the maximum number of Hit Points possible. Additionally, the effects of curses are suppressed within 1 mile of the lair.

If the unicorn dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
