Primal Spirit of Heat and Flame

**Habitat:** Desert, Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire); **Treasure:** None

Fire elementals arise when spirits of the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofFire) inhabit flames, burning cinders, and heated smoke. These beings are tangible despite largely being made of flames and particles, and they can uses their vague limbs to ignite foes and flammable materials. Fire elementals typically burn in shades of orange and red, but other colors are possible. Most on the Material Plane are summoned by magical means, or they might appear near rifts amid desert depths, volcanoes, wildfires, or magma flows that connect to their home plane.

All the elements bow to fire. The strongest earth melts. Water boils. Even air ignites. We are all souls of flame, and we know what it is to burn.

—Marrake the Incandescent, ruler of efreet

Fire elementals might burn in distinctive ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Fire Elemental Compositions table to inspire a fire elemental’s features.

Robson Michel[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/06-003.fire-giants.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/06-003.fire-giants.png)

Fire giants inhabit the hollow vaults and molten rivers of mountainous depths. There, they use subterranean heat and riches to craft wonders, from titanic weapons of war to delicate works of art.

Fire giants have broad frames, skin tones in a variety of rocklike shades, and hair like flame.

Most fire giants dwell in volcanically active mountains or cavernous depths that house their fortress-forges. Evil fire giants tend to be martially minded, and they craft mighty arms to conquer their neighbors and seize valuable resources. More temperate fire giants trade their works for what they need, and they might share the ancient techniques of Giant artisans with other craftspeople. In either case, fire giants are prone to undertaking ambitious designs, and they rarely appreciate interruptions in their titanic workshops.

Skull Smoldering with Magical Obsession

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Flameskulls are flying skulls that blaze with magical fire and the half-remembered arcana of dead spellcasters. They rise from the remains of dead magic-users who were reanimated by sinister necromancers or whose magical pursuits drive them beyond death. Flameskulls might serve as guardians for their creators or pursue ambitions left unfulfilled in life. They lash out at foes with destructive spells and bursts of fire, wielding magic without the need for most components.

Flameskulls take various forms, from skulls with humanlike features to ones with fearsome or bestial alterations. Their flames vary in color and grow more intense when they’re angry. Roll on or choose a result from the Flameskull Details table to inspire what makes a flameskull distinctive.

Bizarre creatures with aberrant agendas inhabit the Underdark. Flumphs number among the few that are helpful to strangers.

These tentacled, telepathic creatures jet through the air in short bursts, venting gases with a sound that gives them their name. Rather than speaking, flumphs communicate telepathically and by changing color to reflect their moods.

Flumphs dwell in psychically charged regions or near creatures with psionic magic. They harmlessly feed off psychic energies, but in doing so, they often encounter dangerous beings such as aboleths and mind flayers. While flumphs generally avoid combat, they often help adventurers in peril. Such help might be of doubtful use, but flumphs mean well.

Once infamous for their magical aptitude, fomorians are giants afflicted with a fey curse. In their pride, they were tricked into invading the [Feywild](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Feywild) to claim its magic for their own. When the archfey rulers of that realm united, the fomorians were turned back and cursed with supernatural strangeness to make their bodies match their vile souls. Ever since, fomorians have dwelled in the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) amid the ruins of their magical cities. The archfey’s curse afflicts them still, tormenting them with wandering cankers, lurching organs, and stranger discomforts. Rather than atoning for their offenses, fomorians harness the magic of their curse and turn it against others. Roll on or choose a result from the Fomorian Warping table to inspire the cosmetic effects a creature undergoes while they’re affected by a fomorian’s Warping Hex.

All-Father Annam banished his son, Karontor, for Karontor’s part in the fomorian assault on the Feywild. That day, the ordning—the hierarchy of the giants and their gods—changed forever, and the fomorians were part of it no more.

Giant of the Ice and Snow

**Habitat:** Arctic, Mountain; **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Robson Michel[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/06-008.frost-giants.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/06-008.frost-giants.png)

From glacial mountain heights and vast tundras rise the homes of frost giants. These giants have skin and hair of icy hues. Their natural immunity to cold allows them to flourish in places inhospitable to most other creatures. They use this resilience to aid them when hunting and in combat, bolstering their allies with chilling war cries.

Frost giants often travel far to find food and goods. This leads many to become raiders and earn violent reputations. Others live more peaceably by hunting titanic game or creating sanctuaries from the cold (frequently featuring hot springs or snowy contests). Frost giants sometimes forge partnerships with icy Fey or fire giants dwelling underground, serving as guardians to their realms in exchange for treasure, weapons, and crafts.

The small folk have barely anything worth looting, so they shouldn’t much mind when we take it from them.

—Jarl Grugnur, frost giant
