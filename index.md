## Story

It was the end, the end of the realm as it was known. [[The Devine War]] erupted when the [[Gods]] split into two factions. Their devastating conflict nearly destroying the world, culminating in the creation of [[The Godwound]] - a tear in reality that forced both sides to cease fighting.

The Vineheart Party emerged as mortal heroes during this conflict, protecting people and minimizing casualties. Their actions were so significant that the post-war era became known as The Vineheart Realm, marking the [[Dawn of The New Age]] of mortal self-determination.

[[The Devine War#The Godwound|The Godwound's]] power physically split the main continent into four distinct regions each further developing their own unique cultures and societies.

Now, the world exists in a changed state. The [[Gods]] are diminished but still worshipped, the Godwound remains a constant threat, and the four continents maintain their independence while dealing with new forms of conflict centered around naval power and trade routes. The Vineheart Realm's influence created a foundation for civilization to recover, though tensions between kingdoms persist.

Through all this, mortals have learned to rely more on themselves than divine intervention, developing new forms of magic, technology, and governance to thrive in this transformed world.

While the effects of [[The Godwound|The Godwound]] appears to increase in frequency and organization known as [[The Godwounded|The Wounded]] has emerged to quell this immense magic surge. The [[Wounded Priestesses]] and their [[Wound Containment|rituals]] do appear to be successful, with the growth halted for centuries, the populace doesn't realize the impact.

## Gameplay

As with the rules the general gameplay is based on **Dungeons & Dragons 5e**. However, as with most things, NERDS tend to over complicate shit.

So some aspects of the game will be simplified, depending on the situation. And some elements will be loosely based (or a straight up ripoff) off of **Baulder's Gate 3** in the name of having fun, and not being lame rule sticklers.

Certain aspects such as the [[Bastions Changes|Bastions]] are taken from the **Dungeons & Dragons 2024** rules.
