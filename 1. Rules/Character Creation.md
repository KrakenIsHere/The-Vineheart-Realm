# Creation

When creating a character the **5e** standards are used (mostly)
refer to the book when a subject isn't covered/changed by the descriptions below

## Races
[[DnD 5e Players Handbook (BnW OCR).pdf#page=13|Races]]

Humans are the most common people in the Vineheart Realm, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. 
Not every intelligent race is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. 

Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties.

Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and Tieflings are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play.

> [!INFO] Example
> A Halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a Dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an Elf can be a master of arcane magic. Your character's race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story.

Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.
These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race.

It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

## Customization

### Multiclassing

#### Prerequisites and core mechanics

**Character advancement:** Players may take levels in a new class instead of advancing their current class, creating multiclass characters. The total character level equals the sum of all class levels (e.g., Wizard 3/Fighter 2 = 5th level character). 

**Prerequisites:** Must meet ability score minimums for both current and new classes: 

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Barbarian | Strength 13                 |
| Bard      | Charisma 13                 |
| Cleric    | Wisdom 13                   |
| Druid     | Wisdom 13                   |
| Fighter   | Strength 13 OR Dexterity 13 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 13 AND Wisdom 13  |
| Paladin   | Strength 13 AND Charisma 13 |
| Ranger    | Dexterity 13 AND Wisdom 13  |
| Rogue     | Dexterity 13                |
| Sorcerer  | Charisma 13                 |
| Warlock   | Charisma 13                 |
| Wizard    | Intelligence 13             |

**Proficiency bonus** is based on total character level. Experience points advance according to total character level, not individual classes.

#### Proficiencies gained from multiclassing

When gaining the first level in a new class, characters receive limited proficiencies compared to starting at 1st level:

| Class     | Proficiencies Gained                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Barbarian | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                       |
| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of choice, one musical instrument                       |
| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor, shields                                             |
| Druid     | Light armor, medium armor, shields (non-metal restriction)                     |
| Fighter   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons            |
| Monk      | Simple weapons, shortswords                                                    |
| Paladin   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons            |
| Ranger    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill |
| Rogue     | Light armor, one skill from class list, thieves' tools                         |
| Sorcerer  | None                                                                           |
| Warlock   | Light armor, simple weapons                                                    |
| Wizard    | None                                                                           |

### Multiclass spellcasting rules

**Spell slot calculation:** Add class levels using different weights based on casting progression:

- **Full casters** (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard): full levels
- **Half casters** (Paladin, Ranger): half levels rounded down
- **Third casters** (Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster): one-third levels rounded down

Use the total to determine spell slots from the **Multiclass Spellcaster table**: 

|Level|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st-2nd|2-3|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|3rd-4th|4|2-3|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|5th-6th|4|3|2-3|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|7th-8th|4|3|3|1-2|-|-|-|-|-|
|9th-10th|4|3|3|3|1-2|-|-|-|-|
|11th-12th|4|3|3|3|2|1|-|-|-|
|13th-14th|4|3|3|3|2|1|1|-|-|
|15th-16th|4|3|3|3|2|1|1|1|-|
|17th+|4|3|3|3|2+|1-2|1-2|1|1|

**Spells known and prepared:** Determine separately for each class as if single-classed. Each spell uses its class's spellcasting ability and focus requirements, but any spell slot of appropriate level can cast any known spell. 

**Warlock interaction:** Pact Magic slots work separately but interchangeably with Spellcasting slots. Pact Magic slots recover on short rest while Spellcasting slots require long rest. 

**Important limitations:** Characters may possess higher-level spell slots than the highest-level spells they can learn, and some class features don't stack (Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, Channel Divinity uses). 

### Feat system overview

**Optional rule:** At levels when classes gain Ability Score Improvement, players may choose a feat instead of increasing ability scores. Each feat can only be selected once unless specified otherwise. **Prerequisites must be maintained** - losing a prerequisite suspends feat benefits until regained. 

#### Combat feats

**Crossbow Expert:** Ignores loading property, no ranged disadvantage in melee, bonus action hand crossbow attack when wielding one-handed weapon. 

**Great Weapon Master:** Critical hits and killing blows grant bonus attacks. Can accept -5 to hit for +10 damage with heavy weapons. 

**Polearm Master:** Bonus action butt-end attacks (d4) with polearms, opportunity attacks when creatures enter reach. 

**Sharpshooter:** Long range doesn't impose disadvantage, ignores cover, -5 to hit for +10 damage option. 

**Sentinel:** Opportunity attacks reduce speed to 0, can attack disengaging creatures, reaction attacks when nearby allies are targeted. 

**Shield Master:** Bonus action shoves with shield, add shield AC to DEX saves, potentially negate area damage on successful saves. 

#### Spellcasting feats

**Magic Initiate:** Learn 2 cantrips and 1 first-level spell from chosen class (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard). 

**Spell Sniper** _(requires spellcasting)_: Double spell attack ranges, ignore cover, learn 1 attack cantrip. 

**War Caster** _(requires spellcasting)_: Advantage on concentration saves, perform somatic components with weapons/shields, cast spells as opportunity attacks. 

**Elemental Adept** _(requires spellcasting)_: Ignore resistance to chosen damage type, treat 1s as 2s on damage dice. Can be taken multiple times for different elements.

**Ritual Caster** _(requires INT or WIS 13+)_: Acquire ritual book, copy ritual spells up to half character level. 

#### Defensive and utility feats

**Alert:** Cannot be surprised, +5 initiative, no advantage from unseen attackers. 

**Lucky:** 3 luck points per long rest to reroll dice or force attackers to reroll. 

**Mobile:** +10 speed, Dash ignores difficult terrain, no opportunity attacks from melee targets. 

**Tough:** +2 HP per level retroactively and going forward. 

**Observant:** +5 to passive Perception and Investigation, can read lips, +1 INT or WIS. 

#### Armor and weapon proficiency feats

**Lightly Armored:** Light armor proficiency, +1 STR or DEX. 

**Moderately Armored** _(requires light armor proficiency)_: Medium armor and shield proficiency, +1 STR or DEX. 

**Heavily Armored** _(requires medium armor proficiency)_: Heavy armor proficiency, +1 STR. 

**Medium Armor Master** _(requires medium armor proficiency)_: No Stealth disadvantage, +3 max DEX bonus with 16+ Dexterity. 

**Heavy Armor Master** _(requires heavy armor proficiency)_: Reduce non-magical physical damage by 3, +1 STR. 

**Weapon Master:** Proficiency with 4 weapons, +1 STR or DEX. 

#### Specialized combat styles

**Defensive Duelist** _(requires DEX 13+)_: Reaction to add proficiency bonus to AC when wielding finesse weapons.

**Dual Wielder:** +1 AC with two weapons, can use non-light weapons for two-weapon fighting, draw/sheathe two weapons.

**Martial Adept:** Learn 2 Battle Master maneuvers and gain 1 superiority die (d6).

**Mounted Combatant:** Advantage against smaller unmounted foes, redirect mount attacks, mount takes no damage on successful saves.

#### Comprehensive feat reference

|Feat|Prerequisites|Key Benefits|
|---|---|---|
|**Actor**|None|+1 CHA, advantage on impersonation, mimic voices|
|**Athlete**|None|+1 STR/DEX, improved climbing/jumping, easier prone recovery|

|**Dungeon Delver**|None|Advantage vs traps, secret door detection, fast travel|

|**Tavern Brawler**|None|+1 STR/CON, improvised weapon/unarmed proficiency, grapple bonus|

### Variant human option

**Standard human replacement:** If using optional feat rules, DM may allow variant human traits instead of +1 to all abilities:

- **Ability Score Increase:** +1 to two different abilities
- **Skills:** Proficiency in one skill
- **Feat:** One feat at 1st level (must meet prerequisites)

This variant specifically supports feat-focused character concepts by providing access to combat styles, spellcasting abilities, or utility features from character creation.

### Integration and planning considerations

**Character advancement strategy:** The choice between ability score improvements and feats occurs at class-specific levels (typically 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 19th). Players should plan builds considering both mechanical optimization and character concept.

**Multiclass timing:** Prerequisites must be met when taking the first level in a new class, and spell progression complexity increases significantly with multiple caster classes.  The **delayed feature acquisition** trade-off means multiclass characters sacrifice capstone abilities for versatility.

**Build synergies:** Certain feat combinations create powerful synergies (Polearm Master + Sentinel, Crossbow Expert + Sharpshooter), while multiclassing can enable unique combinations like Paladin/Warlock for short rest smite recovery or Fighter/Wizard for Eldritch Knight enhancement.
