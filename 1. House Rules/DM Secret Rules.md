## PvP Scenarios

If a PvP scenario is determined the DM shall give the player(s) affected, a temporary & limited taste of the godhood the DM possess.

### Divine Victim's Right

When a player betrays the sacred bonds of fellowship by raising arms against their companion, the gods take notice. The wronged soul is temporarily blessed with a fragment of divine authority - a sacred gift meant to restore balance and remind all that treachery carries consequences.

This blessing is not granted lightly, nor is it a tool for revenge. It represents the gods' intervention to protect those wrongfully attacked by their trusted allies. Those who receive this blessing often report feeling a warm golden light flowing through them, accompanied by a sense of righteous purpose.

However, wielding even a fraction of divine power requires great responsibility. The blessed must show restraint and wisdom, using these gifts only to defend themselves and restore peace. Abuse of this divine trust or attempting to extend vengeance beyond self-defense will result in the immediate withdrawal of these powers.

Let this serve as a reminder: The bonds between adventurers are sacred, and those who break them face not just mortal consequences, but divine judgment.
