#### Interrupted Rest:

- Depending on the event, statuses can be applied (Such as Poorly Rested)
- Depending on the event the DM must decide:
	If the rest concludes after the event or if the rest is continued.
- If the rest concludes a partial rest is assumed but not certain

> [!Note] Times for chance based events
> **Day event:** 1d20 roll higher than a 3d12 roll
> - (8.45% Chance)
>
> **Night event:** 1d20 roll higher than a 2d12 roll
> - (27.08% Chance)

### Rest Conditions:
If a rest passes into a new day a status of “Well Rested” may apply based on a counter roll with a **1d10** by the player for the DM’s roll of a **1d12**
> [!Warning] Sleep amount
> Too little or too much sleep can result in the “Poorly Rested” status

#### Keeping watch:
During a Long Rest, party members can “keep watch” The members keeping said watch will only get a partial long rest. In the event of an interrupted rest, the members keeping watch will not have the status “surprised” applied, and will be ready for potential combat.

A rotation can be applied, resulting in all members only getting a partial long rest while passing the full 8 hours

#### Catchup:
An individual short rest can be taken during travel, provided conditions allow.
