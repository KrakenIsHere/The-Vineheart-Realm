## Balor

Demon of Overwhelming Rage

Balors embody demons’ ruinous fury and hatred. Towering, winged terrors, these demonic warlords seethe with wrath, their rage erupting in waves of fire and as a pair of vicious weapons: a sword of crackling lightning and a whip of lashing flames. A balor’s fury persists until the moment of its demise, at which point it explodes—a last act of vengeance against those who slew it. Demon lords and evil gods harness balors’ rage by making balors commanders of armies or guardians of grave secrets.

Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders.

Heralds of doom and plagues on the living, banshees are spirits obsessed by unresolved bitterness or sorrow. These storied phantoms slay any who glimpse them or hear their baleful wails. Although any tormented soul can arise as a banshee, some elven communities particularly fear them and believe that those who hoard or destroy beauty—natural or otherwise—risk returning as a banshee.

Infernal collectors, barbed devils fanatically protect troves of treasure and scour the planes of existence for additions to their hoards. Also known as hamatulas among the ranks of the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells), these devils bedeck their barbed hides with their most prized possessions and trophies taken from those who failed to steal from them. When threatened, barbed devils strike with their thorny limbs and hurl infernal flame.

Barbed devils often serve as guards and accountants for [ice devil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195086-ice-devil) generals, [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195162-pit-fiend) warlords, archdevils, and similarly powerful villains. In return, barbed devils gain protection for their own collections. Many barbed devils also maintain networks of imps that search the planes for treasures of interest or usefully greedy mortals.

Barbed devils rarely collect anything as prosaic as coins and gems. Rather, they pride themselves on having the multiverse’s greatest collection of one kind of thing—typically items of rare pedigree or emblems of power. Barbed devils refuse to steal what they covet; instead they strike bargains to claim both treasure and mortal souls.

Barlguras are demons that embody brutality and killer instincts. They ruthlessly hunt creatures that enter their territories, whether such places are Abyssal wildernesses or locations where these demons have been conjured by wicked magic-users. Barlguras litter their territories with fiendish icons and terrifying evidence of their kills.

Barlguras cooperate with other demons, particularly other barlguras, so long as they have ample prey. Should a region be depleted of creatures to slaughter, these demons turn on one another in frays that can devastate vast expanses.

Barlguras vary in appearance, but all have powerful frames and hands capable of climbing swiftly and delivering crushing blows. If brute force isn’t enough to overwhelm their foes, barlguras can use demonic magic to conjure terrifying illusions and grasping vines. Most barlguras resemble nightmarish apes, and some bear exaggerated versions of features of predators common to the lands the barlguras inhabit. Many embed trophies from past hunts in their demonic bodies.

Reptilian Guardian with a Petrifying Gaze

**Habitat:** Mountain, Underdark; **Treasure:** Any

Brian Valeza[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-006.basilisk.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-006.basilisk.png)

Basilisks are ponderous predators with eight clawed legs, crystalline spines, and mighty jaws. Rather than chasing prey, they use their supernatural gaze to turn creatures to stone and then consume these victims at their leisure. While basilisks are most comfortable in subterranean lairs, many are captured and kept by unscrupulous folk seeking guardians for their treasures.

The remains of [Petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) creatures litter the area where a basilisk hunts. These might be mundane creatures or more unusual beings that had dire encounters with a basilisk. Roll on or choose a result from the Petrified Basilisk Victims table to inspire the statues that might appear in a basilisk’s hunting grounds. There is a 50 percent chance that any of these statues are missing limbs or broken into pieces.

Rule 4: No one carves statues of frightened warriors. If you see one, keep your eyes closed and your ears open.

Devil of Force and Intimidation

**Habitat:** Planar (Nine Hells); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Bearded devils, also known as barbazus, fill the legions of the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells). These cruel soldiers follow the orders of diabolical generals as they defend infernal realms, invade Material Plane worlds, and clash against demons in planes-spanning conflicts.

Left to their own devices, bearded devils encourage mortals to act callously and abuse their power, inflating their egos and inspiring petty tyrannies. Villains aligned with the Nine Hells call on bearded devils to serve as guardians, enforce their will, or fight in wicked armies.

Bearded devils’ eponymous beards consist of grotesque, tentacle-like growths. These squirming, barb-riddled beards carry poison capable of preventing magical healing. Bearded devils are also known for their distinctive glaives, through which they channel hellish energy. Those struck by these unnatural weapons suffer infernal wounds that grow worse until stanched or magically healed.

Lightning-Spewing Glutton

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** Any

Twelve-legged, reptilian predators, behirs endlessly hunt for their next meal. Their short legs propel them quickly across floors and walls. Any prey that behirs can’t chase down, they blast with breaths of powerful lightning.

Legends claim the first behirs were magically created by storm giants during an ancient, multiversal conflict between giants and dragons. The giants used their mastery of weather to alter the essence of blue dragons. The results were the first behirs, which served as hunters with a particular taste for dragon eggs.

Behirs live in sprawling cave systems and elaborate ruins where they can make the most of their exceptional mobility. They are mindful of areas where dragons dwell, as most dragons view behirs as dangerous abominations and attack them on sight. Nevertheless, behirs occasionally hunt for dragon lairs in the hope of finding and devouring unhatched dragon eggs.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-b#Beholder)Beholder

Infamous Many-Eyed Tyrant

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Eric Belisle[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-009.beholder.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-009.beholder.png)

Beholders—also known as eye tyrants—number among the most notorious inhabitants of the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe). Few creatures in the multiverse are as loathed and feared as these maniacal horrors.

A beholder’s distinctive, globular body is dominated by an oversize maw and a gigantic central eye. Ten stalks ending in smaller eyes crown its form. From each of these eleven eyes, a beholder can unleash a different magic power. The central eye can deactivate magic, while the smaller eyes emit rays that inflict various dooms—such as petrifying creatures, disintegrating them, slaying them outright, or other effects.

Beholders possess utterly alien minds. Most exhibit paranoid, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal tendencies, and they act on agendas beyond human reasoning. While some keep to themselves, others force weaker creatures into their service. Still others cultivate grand ambitions, creating networks of minions to manipulate groups, settlements, and whole nations in the Underdark and sometimes the surface world.

Few creatures loathe beholders more than other beholders. Every beholder views itself as the physical and intellectual pinnacle of its species. To them, all other beholders are aberrant rivals to be dominated or destroyed. Conflicts between beholders can last for decades and lay waste to vast subterranean realms.

Beholders are a particular threat to adventurers because both gravitate toward mysterious ruins and sites of great magic. Many beholders collect the magic items and petrified bodies of heroes they’ve defeated, displaying them as trophies.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-b#BeholderLairs)Beholder Lairs

Beholders lurk in cavern complexes they’ve carved using their eye rays deep in the Underdark or in lairs created for them by their servants.

The region containing a beholder’s lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they’re being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

**Warping Terrain.** Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) and rolls a 1 has the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a tool or opening a door or container.
7. **Sleep Ray.** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 16 (the target succeeds automatically if it is a Construct or an Undead). _Failure:_ The target has the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for 1 minute. The condition ends if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.
8. **Petrification Ray.** _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 16. _First Failure:_ The target has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. _Second Failure:_ The target has the [Petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition instead of the Restrained condition.
9. **Disintegration Ray.** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 16. _Failure:_ 36 (8d8) Force damage. If the target is a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force, a 10-foot [Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) of it disintegrates into dust. _Success:_ Half damage. _Failure or Success:_ If the target is a creature and this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it disintegrates into dust.
10. **Death Ray.** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 16. _Failure:_ 55 (10d10) Necrotic damage. _Success:_ Half damage. _Failure or Success:_ The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 Hit Points.

Bonus Actions

**_Antimagic Cone._** The beholder’s central eye emits an antimagic wave in a 150-foot [Cone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect). Until the start of the beholder’s next turn, that area acts as an [Antimagic Field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618860-antimagic-field) spell, and that area works against the beholder’s own Eye Rays.

Dragons of Decay and Despair

**Habitat:** Swamp; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule over what remains.

Black dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and leaving nature with festering wounds.

Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—particularly if they were responsible for it being lost.

Black dragon wyrmlings lurk in bogs and polluted waterways, hunting for prey and weaker creatures to overpower. While older wyrmlings eventually seek their own territories, recently hatched ones might hunt one another, seeking dominance over their clutch and slaying rivals they can’t subjugate.

Most young black dragons claim a hidden lair—typically a dismal place accessible through deadly ruins or a treacherous bog.

Black dragons lurk in dismal ruins, polluted bogs, or other sites gripped by decay.

The region containing an adult or ancient black dragon’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Acrid Haze.** Odorous and stifling fog covers the area within 1 mile of the lair, rendering that area [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured). Travel for creatures other than the dragon and its allies takes twice the usual time in that area.

**Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. A creature that drinks such water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 hour.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

An adult black dragon uses its acid breath to melt the construct defenders of a clockwork fortress

By the time they’re adults, black dragons are among the greatest terrors in the lands they claim. Wretched swamps and monster-haunted ruins grow more dismal and spread under an adult black dragon’s influence. Morbid cultists and doomsayers frequently gather in the dragon’s service, bringing with them undead terrors that answer to the black dragon and aid it in spreading ruin to nearby bastions of beauty and peace.

Plants Sprouted from Evil

**Habitat:** Forest; **Treasure:** None

Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they’re usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.

Left to Right: Vine Blight, Tree Blight, and Needle Blight

Vine blights resemble humans wrapped in vines common to the areas in which they grow, from hairy ivy vines to flowering kudzu. They can cause plants to burst from the ground around themselves and entangle nearby foes.

Unlike most other blights, vine blights can speak. They do so rarely, typically only to convey messages from their masters or to repeat the words of their victims in rasping voices.

Tree blights look like ancient, dead trees with gnarled limbs and splintered hollows. Imbued with bloodlust, these blights feed on the living. Evidence of their past meals is often tangled amid their branches and roots. Tree blights cooperate with other blights, but they attack other tree-shaped beings they encounter, such as awakened trees and treants.

Ancient plants twisted by evil, Gulthias blights feed on blood and despoil the surrounding land, often giving rise to subservient blights. These cursed plants take their name from the story of their creation; the first of their kind was a tree that grew from the stake piercing the heart of the vampire Gulthias. These blights consider all creatures either servants or fertilizer for the blights’ corruption.

It lives, though it looks dead. In an age long past, someone staked a vampire to the earth on this very spot. The wooden stake was yet green and took root. And so grew the Gulthias Tree, reverberating with primal power.

All-Consuming Cosmic Entropy Unleashed

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Any

Mathias Kollros[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-019.blob-of-annihilation.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/02-019.blob-of-annihilation.png)

Honey, I’ve seen horrors that would make you shit your drawers and reach for the nearest drink. And then there’s the blob of annihilation. If you see it, run. And if you can’t get away from it, just hope you dissolve fast.

—Vi, Artificer of Eberron

The blob of annihilation is a coagulation of cosmic entropy conjoined to the remains of dead gods. This malicious entity drifts through [Wildspace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Wildspace) and multiversal expanses inimical to life—vast regions where the chance of encountering it is low.

The blob poses the greatest threat when disasters or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets. The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass. Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf. Nothing can survive within for long.

Only magic items and the corpses of gods and titans can endure inside the blob. Because of that fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve something from within the blob. This quest usually ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in the find of a lifetime.

When the blob appears, roll on or choose a result from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire what extraordinary thing remains within its goop.

Traits

**_Astral Implosion._** If the blob is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it implodes and ejects any creatures and objects engulfed by it into the Astral Sea. The blob itself vanishes, leaving behind a layer of slime on everything that was within 600 feet of it. In 1d20 years, the blob reconstitutes on a random world in the Material Plane.

**_Legendary Resistance (4/Day)._** If the blob fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** The blob has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The blob makes two Pseudopod attacks and uses Engulf. It can replace one attack with a use of Restraining Glob.

**_Pseudopod._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +15, reach 30 ft. _Hit:_ 24 (3d10 + 8) Force damage.

**_Engulf._** The blob moves up to its Speed and can move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures and objects. _Strength Saving Throw:_ DC 23, each creature or object whose space the blob enters for the first time during this move. _Failure:_ The target is engulfed. While engulfed, a target has [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) against attacks and other effects outside the blob, and when the blob moves, the engulfed target moves with it. A nonmagical object is destroyed after spending 1 minute engulfed.

While engulfed, a creature takes 21 (6d6) Force damage at the start of each of its turns, is [suffocating](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SuffocationHazard), has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition, and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. An engulfed creature that is reduced to 0 Hit Points dissolves into ash, which is ejected into the Astral Sea.

_Success:_ The target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.

**_Restraining Glob._** The blob lobs a slimy glob at one Large or smaller creature it can see within 600 feet of itself. _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 23, the targeted creature. _Failure:_ 18 (3d6 + 8) Acid damage. The glob rolls the target 60 feet straight toward the blob, and the target has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn, when the glob harmlessly dissolves. _Success:_ Half damage only.

Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3. Immediately after another creature’s turn, the blob can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The blob regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

**_Decay._** The blob deals 14 (4d6) Necrotic damage to each creature engulfed by it. The blob can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.

**_Grasping Glob._** The blob uses Restraining Glob. The blob can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.

**_Lashing Goop._** The blob makes one Pseudopod attack.

Dragons of Tyranny and Tempests

**Habitat:** Coastal, Desert; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave control and collect followers like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations.

Blue dragons have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.

Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons’ hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons’ influence.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-b#BlueDragonWyrmling)Blue Dragon Wyrmling

Blue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing fearful reputations among weaker creatures. Many wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually betray or abandon their associates. These wyrmlings tempt small groups of creatures into their service, rewarding them with modest treasures and promises of future power.

Blue dragons dwell in arid lands. Their lairs might be death traps meant to entomb invaders or ostentatious fortresses where they plot domination.

The region containing an adult or ancient blue dragon’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Sinkholes.** Sinkholes form more frequently in the area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature in that area other than the dragon and its allies finishes a Long Rest, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sinkhole opens beneath the creature, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 2d4 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

**Spiteful Storms.** Dust devils and thunderstorms rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured).

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

Adult blue dragons command small empires, which might be territories of subjugated followers, shadowy criminal networks, or cultic enclaves. Endlessly suspicious and wary of rivals, these dragons enact elaborate schemes to ruin their foes, test the loyalty of their servants, and ensure their dominance for centuries.

Ancient blue dragons think beyond dominating groups of short-lived servants. Instead, they seek to claim their places above other dragons and their world’s most powerful inhabitants. If world domination seems too tedious or cliché, these dragons might seek to seize control of extraplanar realms, multiworld empires, or forces of reality—like life, storms, or time itself.

Devil of Dread and Obedience

**Habitat:** Planar (Nine Hells); **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables)

Bone devils are gaunt, nightmarish Fiends with pallid skin stretched tight over frames that combine human and insectile features. Also known as osyluths, these Fiends command weaker devils and other beings aligned with infernal legions. Bone devils ensure that the commands of hellish sovereigns are exacted efficiently and that non-devils fulfill their commitments to the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells). They slay those who renege on infernal deals, sending treacherous mortal souls to face unspeakable punishments.

When not serving their diabolical masters, bone devils tempt self-obsessed mortals with promises of other creatures’ adulation and obedience. These devils prop up petty tyrants, helping them grow increasingly calloused and amoral.

Nagas are immortal but not invincible, and powerful magic can end their lives. Bone nagas are skeletal terrors raised from the remains of magically slain nagas or nagas that were killed but that hadn’t yet rejuvenated. They are granted unlife through rituals practiced by cultists, yuan-ti, and morbid spirit nagas. These Undead nagas possess magical abilities similar to those they had in life, along with an eerie gaze that can beguile other creatures.

Bone nagas typically obey those who resurrected them, serving their creators as tireless guards and sharing the lore they collected in life. Undeath disrupts the perfect memory bone nagas enjoyed while alive, leaving them with gaps in their memories or details scrambled into puzzle-like jumbles.

In rare cases, bone nagas continue to pursue the goals they had while alive instead of serving other creatures. Most free-willed bone nagas are evil beings raised from [spirit naga](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195215-spirit-naga) remains, but in unusual instances, bone nagas created from [guardian nagas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195066-guardian-naga) continue good, albeit confused, existences.

Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories. Although these metallic dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they’ve learned, and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don’t shirk from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical sleep and searing them with flame.

Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others’ stories.

Brass dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a nostalgic memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth.

Brass dragons usually dwell in secret caves and canyons near well-traveled routes.

The area containing an adult or ancient brass dragon’s lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Mirages.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [Major Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619025-major-image), requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the spell’s range is 1 mile, and the dragon doesn’t need to see the spot where the illusion appears.

**Refreshing Water.** Water within 1 mile of the lair is magically refreshing. A creature that drinks such water gains 2d4 [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints), and the dragon is immediately aware of the creature’s presence.

Bronze Dragon Wyrmling

Where bronze dragons dwell, wonders flourish. Imaginative yet mindful, these metallic dragons work toward greatness and help others achieve all they can. They strive to preserve innovations, from the works of past civilizations to new discoveries, and they share such works widely. When dealing with shorter-lived beings, bronze dragons prefer to win them over through conversation and cultivation, but they don’t shy from battle when villains keep others from achieving their potential.

Bronze dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities of the sea, and they often make their lairs in places of natural beauty or communities they wish to preserve. Within their dwellings, bronze dragons hoard things they believe will be useful one day. They salvage treasure lost to the sea, reclaiming wealth or sunken ships.

Bronze dragon wyrmlings believe they can solve any problems, and they seek to prove it. They often fixate on local challenges, such as drought or rampant banditry. While their zeal can be charming, these wyrmlings can get in over their heads and might then need help correcting mistakes.

**Buoying Currents.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that lack a Swim Speed ignore the extra cost of movement while swimming.

**Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [Control Weather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619054-control-weather), requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can control the weather within 1 mile of its lair, regardless if the dragon is inside or outside.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
