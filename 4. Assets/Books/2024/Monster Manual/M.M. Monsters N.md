## Nalfeshnee

Demon of Intimidation and Hopelessness

**Habitat:** Planar (Abyss); **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Nalfeshnees seek to dominate all they encounter. Hulking and grotesque, these demons combine misshapen, bestial features with ogre-like frames. Through both brute force and cunning, nalfeshnees compel cultists and weaker demons to serve them in the endless conflicts of the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss) or in plots on the Material Plane.

Many nalfeshnees view themselves as prospective demon lords and seek to conquer realms of their own. They often use promises of fiendish magic or Abyssal alliances to tempt ambitious mortals into ruinous pacts. Should they run out of patience, nalfeshnees conjure visions of the Abyss and other nightmares to terrorize others into obeying.

The Blood War—that ageless clash between devils and demons—helps ensure the balance of the multiverse. At times it makes unlikely allies, but never delude yourself into believing there’s a lesser of two evil. I won’t be thanking a demon for every day I’m spared a devil’s lash.

Hag of Nightmare and Corruption

**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Night hags seek mortals to torment and turn to evil. By day, night hags use supernatural deceptions to plague their victims, shape-shifting to pose as other creatures and make their targets believe the world has turned against them. By night, these hags reinforce their tortures with terrifying dreams. Once they force their targets to desperate limits, night hags claim their victims’ tormented spirits, capturing them in sinister traps called soul bags. The hags then slip between planes of existence to barter stolen souls to vile magic-users and fiendish entities.

Night hags maintain networks of nefarious customers and collect rumors from across the Lower Planes. These hags might part with their secrets in exchange for magic items and other wicked prices.

Traits

**_Coven Magic._** While within 30 feet of at least two hag allies, the hag can cast one of the following spells, requiring no Material components, using the spell’s normal casting time, and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14): [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury), [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar), [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify), [Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619002-locate-object), [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619007-scrying), or [Unseen Servant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619209-unseen-servant). The hag must finish a Long Rest before using this trait to cast that spell again.

**_Magic Resistance._** The hag has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Soul Bag._** The hag has a soul bag. While holding or carrying the bag, the hag can use its Nightmare Haunting action.

The bag has AC 15, HP 20, and Resistance to all damage. The bag turns to dust if reduced to 0 Hit Points. If the bag is destroyed, any souls the bag is holding are released. The hag can create a new bag after 7 days.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The hag makes two Claw attacks.

**_Claw._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +7, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) Slashing damage.

**_Nightmare Haunting (1/Day; Requires Soul Bag)._** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag casts [Dream](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619156-dream), using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting. Only the hag can serve as the spell’s messenger, and the target must be a creature the hag can see on the Material Plane. The spell fails and is wasted if the target is under the effect of the [Protection from Evil and Good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618912-protection-from-evil-and-good) spell or within a [Magic Circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619018-magic-circle) spell.

If the target takes damage from the _Dream_ spell, the target’s Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to that damage. If the spell kills the target, its soul is trapped in the hag’s soul bag, and the target can’t be raised from the dead until its soul is released.

**_Spellcasting._** The hag casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At Will:** [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Etherealness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619193-etherealness), [Magic Missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619022-magic-missile) (level 4 version)

Bonus Actions

**_Shape-Shift._** The hag [shape-shifts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into a Small or Medium Humanoid, or it returns to its true form. Other than its size, its game statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed.

Nightmares resemble horses with flaming manes, burning hooves, and smoldering eyes. They terrorize weaker creatures and often ally with denizens of the Lower Planes in committing evil acts. These supernatural horses can innately travel between the [Ethereal Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#EtherealPlane) and the [Material Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#MaterialPlane), and many know the locations of portals to the Lower Planes, the [Shadowfell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Shadowfell), and other sinister realms.

Nightmares’ speed, resilience, and ability to gallop between planes of existence make them steeds coveted by evildoers. Roll on or choose a result from the Nightmare Riders table to inspire what might employ a nightmare steed.

Witness to the Weird

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Consumed by their thirst for forbidden knowledge, nothics are cursed lore seekers transformed by secrets never meant to be known. The bodies of these former scholars are warped into otherworldly shapes, each with a head dominated by a gigantic, unblinking eye. Nothics remember nothing of their past lives and care only for their endless pursuit of hidden mysteries and uncanny truths. They seek revelations amid the rubble of forgotten ruins, and they use their supernatural sight to pierce magical deceptions, rot the flesh of enemies, and steal the secrets of those who interrupt their investigations.

Some nothics seek to end the curse that warped them into their bizarre forms, but many are unaware of—or uninterested in—their transformation.

Deeper. Deeper and Deeper. Deeper and creeper. Creeping they come. Up from the place that isn’t a place. They come to feed. Feed on what I know. So I hide. I hide away. Away in the secret dark. Secret and dark, like all that I know I shouldn’t know!

Fiendish warmongers, nycaloths relish combat and conquest. These tremendous winged yugoloths teleport around battlefields and into the air to bewilder their foes and attack with constantly shifting, Gehenna-forged axes—mercurial weapons similar to those favored by many yugoloths.

Nycaloths might command groups of [mezzoloths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195122-mezzoloth) and make pacts to serve [arcanaloths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194899-arcanaloth), [ultroloths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195244-ultroloth), fiendish warlords, or wicked mortals. So long as they can indulge their bloodlust, most nycaloths are willing to obey more powerful or cunning creatures. Some even serve competent leaders past the terms of their agreements to achieve long-pursued victories. But masters that lead nycaloths to defeat should fear these proud yugoloths’ retribution.

Nycaloths and other yugoloths frequently serve as mercenary forces in extraplanar conflicts that spill onto the Material Plane. Roll on or choose a result from the Yugoloth Incursions table to inspire the plans of a yugoloth war band.
