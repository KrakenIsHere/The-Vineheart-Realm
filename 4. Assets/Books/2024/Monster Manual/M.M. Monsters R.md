Rakshasa conspirators plot their next atrocity

Masters of manipulation, rakshasas infiltrate communities to claim positions of power. While disguising their true natures, they kidnap victims and indulge their insatiable hunger for flesh.

Rakshasas can withstand some degree of magic, but legends tell of blessed warriors felling them with crossbow bolts, arrows, or similar weapons.

Rakshasas’ appearances combine humanlike bodies with the features of animals and monsters. All rakshasas have a physical oddity that remains when they adopt magical disguises, such as palms where the backs of the hands would be on humans.

Traits

**_Greater Magic Resistance._** The rakshasa automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and the attack rolls of spells automatically miss it. Without the rakshasa’s permission, no spell can observe the rakshasa remotely or detect its thoughts, creature type, or alignment.

**_Fiendish Restoration._** If the rakshasa dies outside the Nine Hells, its body turns to ichor, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere in the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells).

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The rakshasa makes three Cursed Touch attacks.

**_Cursed Touch._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +10, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) Slashing damage plus 19 (3d12) Necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it is [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses). While cursed, the target gains no benefit from finishing a Short or Long Rest.

**_Baleful Command (Recharge 5–6)._** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 18, each enemy in a 30-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from the rakshasa. _Failure:_ 28 (8d6) Psychic damage, and the target has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions until the start of the rakshasa’s next turn.

**_Spellcasting._** The rakshasa casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At Will:** [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Detect Thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619099-detect-thoughts), [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619102-disguise-self), [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand), [Minor Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619039-minor-illusion)

Red Dragon Wyrmling

Red dragons take whatever they desire and burn to ash anything that stands in their way. These chromatic dragons endlessly desire more—more magic, territory, treasure, or whatever else inflames their cruel ambitions.

Red dragons make their lairs amid perilous cliffs and volcanoes. Within, they amass and fiercely protect hoards of treasure, and many have perfect recall of the hoards' contents and the locations of all they’ve collected. Should anything go missing, red dragons fly into rages. They don’t rest until their treasures are returned and the thieves have burned.

Red dragons believe themselves to be the greatest of all dragons and, by extension, the greatest of all creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are their right—treasures can find no more honored place than in their hoards, and other creatures are privileged to serve them.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-r#RedDragonWyrmling)Red Dragon Wyrmling

Red dragon wyrmlings are born destroyers. From a young age, they delight in igniting objects and creatures alike. They sometimes restrain themselves from scorching creatures to instead bully others into following their orders and bringing them gifts.

Young red dragons number among the most unpredictable of their kind. They seek territories rich with treasures and potential followers, raiding, burning, and slaughtering to enforce their will. Unless these dragons meet significant resistance, they cement their power and begin reigns of terror that can last for centuries.

Red dragons make their lairs in smoldering, unapproachable places such as volcanic mountains, burning wastelands, and ruins they’ve stolen from other creatures.

The region containing an adult or ancient red dragon’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Burning Heat.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of extreme heat. A burning creature or object takes an additional 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Smoldering Haze.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) with clouds of ash. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 hour.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

An adult red dragon unleashes its fury, reducing a city to ruin

Adult red dragons are tyrants that claim vast domains and might command armies of followers or significant magical resources. Red dragons rarely pay attention to the nations and claims of smaller creatures, and they might consider entire cities part of their realm. Most red dragons are inattentive rulers, though, spending decades focused on their own comforts, hoards, or magical concerns within their lairs. But when their attention returns to their territories, if they find matters not to their liking, whole lands might burn.

Ancient red dragons number among the most feared and destructive beings in the multiverse. Few can withstand the wrath of an ancient red dragon that turns its mind toward devastation. These dragons’ greed matches their ruinous potential, and they collect vast hoards studded with storied treasures and magic items. Their lairs frequently tap into volcanic depths and might pierce other planes of existence, bringing servants from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofFire) or the Lower Planes into their service.

Revenants possess the bodies they had in life, using them to hunt down their killers. If their bodies are destroyed, they take control of new bodies that gradually change to resemble the revenants’ original forms.

Traits

**_Regeneration._** The revenant regains 10 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. If the revenant takes Fire or Radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. Its body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn’t regenerate.

**_Undead Restoration._** If the revenant dies, it revives 24 hours later in a different body unless [Dispel Evil and Good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619096-dispel-evil-and-good) is cast on its corpse. If it revives, it animates a Humanoid corpse elsewhere on the same plane of existence; it now looks different but uses the same stat block and returns with all its Hit Points.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The revenant uses Vengeful Glare and makes two Slam attacks.

**_Slam._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +7, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) Necrotic damage.

**_Vengeful Glare._** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 15, one creature the revenant can see within 30 feet. _Failure:_ The target has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically. If the Frightened target is cursed by the revenant (see Vow of Revenge), the target also has the [Paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) condition for the duration.

Bonus Actions

**_Vow of Revenge (1/Day)._** The revenant curses one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The revenant knows the distance to and direction of the [cursed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses) target, even if it is on a different plane of existence. The curse ends on the target if the revenant uses this Bonus Action on a different creature.

Haunting revenants possess ruins and forsaken places connected with their deaths—such as abandoned buildings, wrecked ships, or junk heaps. These revenants lurk in plain sight, waiting for their foes to near, then trap their victims within their massive bodies. Those inside a revenant might be battered by animate furnishings or more unsettling manifestations of the revenant’s hatred.

The places haunting revenants lurk swiftly gain infamous reputations.

Birds of prey of fantastic scale, rocs hunt over vast territories and can snatch whole elephants, whales, or wagons in their talons. They then carry their prey back to their remote nests, journeys that can take days and cover hundreds of miles.

Camouflaged as rock formations, ropers are aberrant ambushers that lurk in wait for smaller creatures. These bizarre subterranean hunters extend their rubbery tentacles to explore and prod their surroundings, often reaching beyond their fields of vision. Should they encounter prey, these limbs ensnare victims and drag them close to ropers’ toothy maws. If these tentacles are severed, ropers rapidly grow replacements.

Ropers can move, albeit slowly. Crawling on the sticky cilia that cover their undersides, ropers can climb walls and suspend themselves from ceilings. These hunters often position themselves in unexpected or treacherous locations, using their surroundings to weaken their prey. Roll on or choose a result from the Roper Hazards table to inspire what dangers ropers employ when ambushing prey.

Rust monsters roam the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) searching for ferrous metal. When they find this material—whether natural veins, subterranean structures, or creatures’ equipment—these beetle-like scavengers rush to feed. Using their feathery antennae, rust monsters dissolve metals such as iron and steel into rusted scrap. They easily gnaw through this corroded metal using their mandibles. Rust monsters usually ignore creatures without metal equipment, but they defend themselves if attacked.
