## Vampires

Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night

**Habitat:** Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Any

Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.

Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun’s searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire’s grim sanctuary.

Vampire familiars are living people who serve vampires, either willingly or due to coercion by their deathless masters. They channel deathly energy through their weapons, incapacitating unsuspecting targets and leaving their victims as helpless prey for their vampire masters.

Many vampire familiars aspire to eventually become vampires, while others are magically charmed or serve as part of some terrible bargain. In each case, these vampire servants show signs of their vampiric corruption, such as corpse-like complexions, uncanny reflexes, and evidence of their masters’ repeated feedings. A vampire familiar loses its supernatural abilities and returns to its original Humanoid state if its vampire master is destroyed.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-v#VampireLairs)Vampire Lairs

Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.

The region containing a vampire’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Children of the Night.** The vampire exerts influence over the animals in its domain. From dusk until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition while within 1 mile of the lair.

**Looming Shadows.** Shadows within 1 mile of the lair seem to move as if alive. Any creature (excluding the vampire and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

**Mists.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire and any creatures of its choice are unaffected by the fog.

If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

When the spell ends, the target is unaware it was Charmed by the vampire.

**_Shape-Shift._** If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it [shape-shifts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 30 ft.) or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 20 ft.
