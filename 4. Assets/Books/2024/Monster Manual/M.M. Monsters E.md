Primal spirits from the [Elemental Plane of Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofEarth) merge with rocks and minerals to form earth elementals. These beings possess powerful limbs and coarse features, sometimes studded with ore, gems, crystals, colorful striations, or living plants. On the Material Plane, earth elementals often serve those who conjure them, or they appear in regions influenced by their home plane, such as crystalline nodes, energetic fault lines, or veins of magical ore. Earth elementals effortlessly move through stone and can bring ruin to whole structures with their mighty fists.

Earth elementals are typically made of more than dirt. While an elemental’s composition doesn’t change its statistics or have monetary value, it makes each elemental distinct. Roll on or choose a result from the Earth Elemental Compositions table to inspire an earth elemental’s features.

The foundations of our homes, the strength of our weapons, the vaults of our greatest secrets—earth is nothing less than the grip of reality itself. It is the mightiest element. This cannot be denied.

Genie of Fire

**Habitat:** Desert, Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Michael Broussard[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-002.efreeti.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-002.efreeti.png)

Efreet burn with the energy and unpredictability of fire. Their innate magic allows them to conjure flames from nothing and shape treasures within magical infernos. Many efreet have wicked reputations, as their fickle natures and love for dramatic conflagrations can be destructive. Other efreet delight in fire’s beauty, be it the delicacy of a candle flame or the shared wonder of fireworks. These genies might aid mortals in exchange for treasures or the liberation of captive Elementals.

On many worlds, efreet dwell in sweltering deserts and volcanic regions. Those that make their homes on the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofFire) create incredible cities among seas of flame and molten minerals. Eclipsing all of these is the storied [City of Brass](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#CityofBrass), a gleaming metropolis that is one of the most wondrous cities in the multiverse. Here, magic tempers the plane’s extreme heat, making the City of Brass a hub of trade between planes of existence.

Imagine seas of platinum and liquid flame, the Crimson Pillar with fires hot enough to sear the gods, and the infinite delights of the City of Brass. Now imagine what my master offers...

The End and Beginning of Ages

**Habitat:** Planar (Elemental Chaos); **Treasure:** None

Beyond the fringes of the Elemental Planes, primordial forces endlessly clash amid the Elemental Chaos. Within the vastness and violence of this realm rage elemental cataclysms, entities spawned from the raw forces of the multiverse and awash in dissonant elemental powers. These beings of primal conflict annihilate nearly all they encounter and seed the ruins left in their wake with the potential for new creations.

Elemental cataclysms rarely escape the Elemental Chaos. When they do, it is typically due to some planar disruption or the summons of nihilistic cultists. When they emerge on Material Plane worlds, elemental cataclysms create realm-altering trails of destruction, carelessly destroying cities and throwing whole nations into chaos. The rampages aren’t random. Elemental cataclysms abhor anything that visibly mars nature, be it mines or monuments, fortresses or cities, but they vent their most intense rage on works of metal and clockwork. As they sow destruction, they howl condemnation and chant words of unmaking in the languages of the Inner Planes.

Little can stop an elemental cataclysm. Those that oppose one of these calamities often attempt to reverse the ritual that summoned it, coax it through a planar rift, or conjure another titan in hopes that the two destroy one another. These terrors leave a wake of ashes, floods, storms, and broken earth. But after these disasters recede, the land is imbued with new life or environmental changes. Roll on or choose a result from the Elemental Alterations table to inspire what changes emerge after an elemental cataclysm’s destruction.

Celestial and fiendish empyreans observe the cosmos attended by sigil-like empyrean iotas

Empyreans are the spawn of deities. While not gods themselves, they possess divine influence and powers related to their divine parents. Some empyreans are near-demigods with fantastic might and the power to reshape mortal lives. Others are little more than divine thoughts or moments of immortal attention made manifest. Whether empyreans are idealized beings or vestiges of divinity, their appearances are influenced by their creators.

Empyrean iotas are the thoughts, memories, or indirect attentions of deities personified and given a measure of autonomy. Resembling floating glyphs, motes of color, icons of divinity, or stranger shapes, these beings are messengers of the gods and aides to those gods’ servants. Iotas have their own knowledge and personalities, though they might know little more than the realms and wishes of their creators.

Inheritors of divine might, empyreans are idealized, human-shaped beings of godly power. These beings might have relationships with their creators akin to those of parents and their children, royalty and their servants, inventors and their creations, or other bonds. Empyreans’ existences are fundamentally influenced by their patrons and their connection to the heavenly deities of the Upper Planes or the fiendish deities of the Lower Planes. Nevertheless, empyreans have free will.

Celestial empyreans are typically noble beings who quest to prove themselves worthy of their divine pedigree. Many work in the service of their parents or support those gods’ causes and champions.

Fiendish empyreans are usually dreadful, self-serving villains who seek to claim their parents’ power. Some forge unholy armies or rule over hidden realms in mockery of true gods, while others might seek to escape their accursed families.

One day I might be the god of storms—mind countless followers, answer prayers, change whole worlds—but, until then, I do what I please.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-e#Erinyes)Erinyes

Devil of Vengeance and Righteous Wrath

**Habitat:** Planar (Nine Hells); **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Erinyes, also known as furies, are winged devils clad in fiendish armor. These fallen angels exact a merciless form of divine justice, hunting down oath breakers and dragging the rightfully damned to the Nine Hells in the grip of their magical ropes. Few ever glimpse what lies within these devils’ armored exteriors, and erinyes ensure that those who do can never speak of what they’ve seen.

Erinyes often serve archdevils and guard the order of the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells) against trespassers and escapees. Although they’re prone to wrathful outbursts, erinyes cooperate well with other devils. They sometimes hunt in trios with other erinyes, forging infamous reputations for themselves.

When not in the service of a diabolical master, erinyes hunt wicked souls. They pursue quarries relentlessly, across the multiverse and for ages if need be. While they might be summoned to serve evil magic-users, erinyes also listen for oaths and curses sworn in their names. In rare cases, wronged mortals who call out with just rage might be heard by an erinyes who appears to take vengeance on their behalf. Once erinyes are so summoned, they won’t leave without claiming the soul of either their quarry or the mortal who summoned them.

Venomous Arachnid Abductor

**Habitat:** Forest; **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables)

Sean Murray[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-007.ettercap.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-007.ettercap.png)

Spiderlike hunters, ettercaps lurk in forested depths and seek prey to drag into their web-choked lairs. These vicious predators have arachnid features and hunched, bipedal frames, and they’re notorious for their venomous bites and ability to shoot out webs to entrap their victims. Ettercaps often hunt in small groups alongside giant spiders and mundane spider swarms.

Ettercaps frequently overhunt their environment. Left unchecked, ettercaps might fill whole woodlands with their webs and the cocooned remains of past meals, which puts ettercaps in conflict with Fey. Spiteful ettercaps go out of their way to torment and feed on Fey; they prefer to menace those smaller than themselves, like [pixies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195164-pixie) and [sprites](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775845-sprite). They rarely devour other sapient creatures swiftly, preferring to cocoon their captives and terrorize them for days.

Ettercaps avoid fire, which can quickly burn through their webs and the dead trees where they make their homes.

Quarrelsome Two-Headed Giant

**Habitat:** Hill, Mountain, Underdark; **Treasure:** [Individual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/creating-adventures#IndividualTreasure)

Robson Michel[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-008.ettin.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/05-008.ettin.png)

Ettins are physically powerful Giants with two heads. While many ettins have features similar to hill giants, others have more bestial or unusual traits, such as tusks, short horns, or a single eye on each head.

Ettins frequently ally with other Giants or groups that value their strength, such as hill giants, bandits, or ogres. Some ettins possess mystical ties to the lands they inhabit, and they might know or guard secrets valued by druids or Fey.

Each ettin head has a distinct personality. While this makes some ettins quarrelsome with themselves and others, many function as a team. An ettin head might have its own name, or both heads might refer to themselves as a single being—either with one name or a portmanteau of two.

Roll on or choose a result from the Ettin Interactions table to inspire how an ettin’s heads are interacting when the creature is encountered.
