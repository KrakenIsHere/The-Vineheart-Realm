Primal Spirit of Waves and Tides

**Habitat:** Coastal, Planar (Elemental Plane of Water), Swamp, Underwater; **Treasure:** None

Spirits of the [Elemental Plane of Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofWater) form shapeless liquids into water elementals, aqueous beings with the might of surging waves. Water elementals are as mutable as liquid, allowing them to crash into foes and seep through narrow cracks. They can crush foes with limb-like geysers, or they might flood over creatures, submerging and drowning foes within their whirling forms. Water elementals often appear near nexuses of elemental power, such as aquatic abysses, magical springs, and whirlpools.

Water elementals’ shapes are influenced by the liquid bodies in which they form. Roll on or choose a result from the Water Elemental Compositions table to inspire a water elemental’s features.

Servant of Primeval Magic

**Habitat:** Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Any

Serpentine nature spirits, water weirds protect pools, fountains, and magical bodies of water. In the water, these creatures are indistinguishable from the liquid surrounding them. Should their aquatic territory be disturbed, they rise as animate water spouts with vague snake- or dragon-like features. Often their appearance is enough to drive off foes, but if forced to fight, water weirds crush enemies within their fluid coils.

Water weirds might protect a site for generations and learn much about their surroundings. Some gain reputations as oracles and might respond to questions posed to them in Primordial. Since water weirds don’t speak, they often communicate using spouts of water or objects submerged in their pools.

Rule 2: Before you drink from a fountain or pool, toss a copper coin into it. It’s a small price to pay for your life!

**Habitat:** Arctic, Forest, Hill; **Treasure:** Relics

When threatened or compelled by magic, werebears shape-shift from their humanoid forms into mighty bears or hybrids of those two forms. They scare off or sabotage those who threaten the wilds, and they frequently aid Fey, druids, or spirits of the wilderness, as many owe their magical nature to such forces. Werebears take the shape of bears common to the regions in which they dwell, with brown and polar bear forms being common.

**Habitat:** Forest, Urban; **Treasure:** Individual

Wererats can shape-shift from their humanoid forms into giant rats or humanoid-rat hybrids. These creatures can transform voluntarily, but some are magically compelled to shape-shift when exposed to complete darkness or during nights of a new moon. Often, wererats’ nature results from a divine curse—punishment for their deceitful natures or the crimes of their treacherous families. Wererats frequently work in groups, forming bandit gangs or thieves’ guilds.

Weretigers shape-shift from humanoid forms into tigers or tiger-humanoid hybrids. Although they can transform at will or when their magical nature demands, many weretigers are nocturnal and transform into their bestial shapes at night. Some weretigers’ transformations might also be tied to the crescent moon, seasons, or momentous events. Weretigers often view their abilities as a blessing or a family honor, and they use their shape-shifting abilities to defend something with historic importance. Roll on or choose a result from the Weretiger Wards table to inspire what a weretiger defends.

Dragons of Cold and Cruelty

**Habitat:** Arctic; **Treasure:** Arcana

Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white dragons prioritize survival over all. Life is harsh and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival.

White dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-w#WhiteDragonWyrmling)White Dragon Wyrmling

White dragon wyrmlings usually head off on their own soon after hatching. While the cold means little to these creatures, food is scarce in arctic realms, and predators there are merciless. Most white dragon wyrmlings survive by scavenging, hunting opportunistically, and quickly fleeing foes—including other white dragons.

White dragons brood in bitterly cold lairs clawed from stone and ice.

The region containing an adult or ancient white dragon’s lair is affected by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Frigid Cold.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of extreme cold. Any water in that area is frigid water. See the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024) for rules on [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#ExtremeCold) and [frigid water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#FrigidWater).

**Glacial Gloom.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) by chilly fog. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its Speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

Adult white dragons claim large territories and are often the mightiest predators in those lands. While some lurk in their lairs for months, others regularly soar over their domains. When they spot something moving on the ice, they might swoop down to feed or extort food and offerings from sapient creatures.

Like arctic storms, ancient white dragons threaten icy realms. They emerge from their frozen lairs to indulge their hungers for food or treasure, menacing other creatures with lethal cold. While they might ignore animals or small groups of polar wanderers, these dragons are quick to challenge other dragons and creatures wielding powerful magic, hoping to add their foes’ skulls and magic items to their own hoards.

Wights are the withered corpses of relentless warriors whose wickedness sustains them beyond death. Unlike mere zombies, they retain the memories and evil agendas they harbored in life.

After dying and returning from the grave, a wight continues its villainous ways, but it is now driven by a hunger for life. A wight drains living essence through its attacks. Humanoids slain by a wight’s life-sapping grip reanimate a day later and serve the wight as obedient zombies.

From a distance, will-o’-wisps look like lanterns bobbing in the dark. Through the windows of abandoned structures or around the bends of treacherous paths, these spirits tempt the curious into peril. Once their prey is vulnerable, will-o’-wisps feed on the life force of those they lay low.

Roll on or choose a result from the Will-o’-Wisp Ambushes table to inspire how a will-o’-wisp imperils its victims.

Coldhearted Pack Hunter

**Habitat:** Arctic; **Treasure:** None

Winter wolves are horse-size, supernatural predators that prowl frigid wildernesses in deadly packs. With their great size and chilling breath, winter wolves pursue megafauna, arctic travelers, and any other creatures they catch on the tundra.

Winter wolves are more intelligent than natural [wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775850-wolf) and can speak. Most are predominantly concerned with their next meal, and while they might converse with other creatures in exchange for food, few concern themselves with long-term bargains or keeping their word unless they have something to gain. Winter wolves often hunt alongside [frost giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195001-frost-giant) that indulge them with frequent hunts and reliable meals.

Snowdrifts, driving hail, and wind fierce enough to strip the hairless skin off your bones—you lot have been through it all. But good news, there’s a town full of warm hearths right over this rise.

You’ll never reach it, but at least your last thoughts will be warm.

—Koran, winter wolf

Essence of Evil

**Habitat:** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Wraiths are spectral evils, life-hungry embodiments of malice and terror. Arising from the souls of tyrants, moments of catastrophic pain, or magical blasphemies, wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. Humanoids that die near a wraith might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as specters bound to the wraith’s sinister will.

Wraiths lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins, or lands influenced by sinister planes of existence. Such haunted domains might bear hints of the tragedies or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being.

Draconic Hunter with a Venomous Sting

**Habitat:** Hill, Mountain; **Treasure:** Any

Fury Galluzzi[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/23-015.wyvern.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/23-015.wyvern.png)

Opportunistic predators, wyverns are draconic ambushers that strike from above. These territorial hunters attack with their fangs and stinger-tipped tails. Wyvern stingers drip with deadly venom, a painful toxin feared by monster hunters and coveted by alchemists.

Wyverns are aggressive and claim sizable territories around the mountains, crags, and ruins where they dwell. Despite their considerable strength, they’re opportunistic hunters that target unwitting livestock and groups of encamped travelers. Wyverns usually land only to finish off creatures they’ve weakened with their poison and strafing attacks. Creatures that fight back or take flight might deter wyverns, convincing them to search for easier prey.

Once wyverns overpower a quarry, they carry it to their cavernous lairs to either consume it in safety or trap it to eat later. Most wyverns don’t hoard treasure, but their lairs are littered with the possessions of past victims. It isn’t uncommon for wyverns to carry off chests, carts, or small boats along with their prey.
