## Tarrasque

The Shape of Calamity

**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** None

Chris Rahn[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/20-001.tarrasque.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/20-001.tarrasque.png)

Among the most devastating creatures in existence, the tarrasque is an engine of catastrophe and a ruiner of nations. A terror of massive size and overwhelming might, this primeval destroyer survives from the earliest epochs of the Material Plane, when it served as a weapon of immortal forces. Since then, the tarrasque has slumbered in secret, rising every few ages to usher in eras of destruction.

The tarrasque is a bipedal, prehistoric Monstrosity that stands over seventy feet tall. Bristling with horns and spikes, its spiny carapace deflects harm and can reflect magical attacks.

The tarrasque is a creature of tireless rage. It lashes out at any creature that catches its attention, thrashing with claws and its mighty tail while swallowing smaller beings whole. It seems to take instinctual offense at the works of lesser beings, venting its rage at buildings, bridges, ships, and monuments. The larger a structure or foe is, the greater the tarrasque’s wrath.

It is a mystery what—if anything—calms the tarrasque, but eventually it returns to its slumber, leaving the world irrevocably changed. While the tarrasque might be halted by incredible opposition, its threat can never be wiped from the multiverse. Whenever the tarrasque is defeated, another tarrasque awakes somewhere else on the Material Plane.

Few things survive the tarrasque’s rampages, and reports of the monster’s devastation are often contradictory, incomplete, or beyond belief. In cases where it leaves no survivors, its calamities might initially be blamed on evil dragons or magical disasters, but the tarrasque frequently leaves behind some unmistakable indication of its passage. Roll on or choose a result from the Tarrasque Evidence table to inspire what marks the monster’s rampages.

Mantid Psychics and Scavengers

**Habitat:** Desert, Grassland; **Treasure:** [Armaments](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArmamentsTables)

Thri-kreen are mantis-like wanderers who harness their innate camouflage and psychic abilities to survive. Different groups of thri-kreen have distinct carapaces, from the rocky shades of desert dwellers to the vibrant hues of those living in verdant lands. While their language has a distinctly insectile quality, thri-kreen often use telepathy to communicate, and groups can rapidly share a wealth of detailed information without making a sound.

I would tell you now the tale of the first Ka’Cha, the first thri-kreen who knew and taught the truth: that the clutch is all.

—Ka’Cha, thri-kreen knowledge hunter

Thri-kreen marauders employ weapons made of stone and bone, such as the spear-like gythka and throwing blades called chatkcha.

A treant evicts adventurers from a city it has reclaimed for nature

Ancient inhabitants of the forest, treants are gigantic, animate trees with wizened faces. Most have lived for centuries and know secrets of the natural world. They avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of shorter-lived creatures, but they’re protective of their forest homes. If roused to anger, treants can animate trees to aid them.

Treants defend and are shaped by secrets of the forest. Roll on or choose a result from the Treant Secrets table to inspire what mysteries a treant protects.

With features similar to those of pale cave lizards, troglodytes stalk the [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) in an endless hunt for food. Troglodytes consume almost anything, including bones, giant insects, and other subterranean dwellers. They prey on subterranean communities and those near entrances to the Underdark, stealing livestock and kidnapping residents.

Troglodytes prefer to ambush prey and can change their scale color to blend in with their surroundings. They often climb along cavern walls or emerge from deep fissures to take their prey by surprise. Despite their stealthiness, these stalkers exude a distinctly repulsive stench. Descriptions of what troglodytes smell like span a spectrum as complex as it is vile. This reek nauseates many who smell it, but it can also warn of the presence of troglodytes before they strike.

Loathsome, Regenerating Lurker

**Habitat:** Arctic, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Trolls creep forth to prey on smaller creatures and drag captives back to festering lairs. These misshapen brutes can regenerate from wounds and regrow severed body parts—including their heads. A troll’s severed limbs continue to move and attack. Unless they’re burned by flames or acid, trolls can recover from egregious wounds and seek revenge on those who felled them.

Trolls typically hunt alone, but small groups occasionally cooperate to ambush prey or raid villages. Creatures such as hags and hill giants might convince trolls to work for them in exchange for disgusting meals.

Traits

**_Loathsome Limbs (4/Day)._** If the troll ends any turn [Bloodied](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied) and took 15+ Slashing damage during that turn, one of the troll’s limbs is severed, falls into the troll’s space, and becomes a [Troll Limb](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195240-troll-limb). The limb acts immediately after the troll’s turn. The troll has 1 [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level for each missing limb, and it grows replacement limbs the next time it regains Hit Points.

**_Regeneration._** The troll regains 15 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. If the troll takes Acid or Fire damage, this trait doesn’t function on the troll’s next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The troll makes three Rend attacks.

**_Rend._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +7, reach 10 ft. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) Slashing damage.

Bonus Actions

**_Charge._** The troll moves up to half its Speed straight toward an enemy it can see.

Traits

**_Regeneration._** The limb regains 5 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. If the limb takes Acid or Fire damage, this trait doesn’t function on the limb’s next turn. The limb dies only if it starts its turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn’t regenerate.

**_Troll Spawn._** The limb uncannily has the same senses as a whole troll. If the limb isn’t destroyed within 24 hours, roll 1d12. On a 12, the limb turns into a [Troll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195241-troll). Otherwise, the limb withers away.

Actions
