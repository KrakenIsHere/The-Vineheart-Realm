## Yetis

Chilling Stalkers of the Frozen Wilds

**Habitat:** Arctic; **Treasure:** Any

Across alpine extremes and frozen frontiers, yetis hunt those that trespass in their territories. Reclusive and merciless, they resemble giant apes with pale fur and ram-like horns. Yetis easily blend in with snow and icy cliffs, revealing themselves with blood-chilling howls just before striking with their icy claws. In addition to their physical might, yetis can chill creatures with a look, freezing their foes in place, and they can conjure ice and hurl it at foes.

Due to yetis’ elusiveness, folktales about yetis are more common than sightings. Whether a distant scream is the howl of an enraged yeti or just the wind, few can be certain. Nevertheless, many mountainous settlements burn bonfires to ward off yetis, taking advantage of these brutes’ aversion to fire.

Yetis hunt alone or in small family groups. They avoid the settlements of other creatures but lurk near paths frequented by traders and herders to pick off unsuspecting prey. Yetis make their homes in icy caves near frozen peaks and at extremes where few dare travel.

Giants even among their own intimidating kind, abominable yetis are stronger and bloodthirstier than their kin. They claim whole regions as their hunting grounds, and they might track trespassers for days. On sighting prey, abominable yetis fling boulders of ice and snow before closing to finish foes. In addition to their icy claws and gaze, they can exhale a blast of arctic cold.

Abominable yetis dwell in frigid ruins or the deserted lairs of other monsters atop infamous peaks.

Demon of Depraved Will

**Habitat:** Planar (Abyss); **Treasure:** None

Sean Murray[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/25-003.yochlol.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/25-003.yochlol.png)

Yochlols embody the pernicious will and infectious philosophies of the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss). In their rarely seen true forms, these noxious manipulators appear as ever-shifting masses of dripping tentacles and toxic flesh crowned by a single baleful eye. More often, though, yochlols take the form of spiders or zealous cultists. They use manipulative magic and dangerous rhetoric to spread demonic cults, corrupt the righteous, and further the plots of their fiendish overlords. They relish coercing the unwitting into furthering demonic plots and turning mortals against one another.

Most yochlols serve [Lolth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layer66TheDemonweb). The Demon Queen of Spiders claims all yochlols as minions and orders any yochlols that disagree destroyed. In rare cases, yochlols might serve other demon lords, particularly manipulative or changeable ones like [Graz’zt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layers4547Azzagrat), [Juiblex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layer222TheSlimePits), and [Zuggtmoy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Layer222TheSlimePits).

Despite their service to demon lords, yochlols harbor their own vicious whims and ambitions. They might claim to speak for their overlords to further their own ambitions or seek to reveal rivals’ selfish goals to gain standing with their demonic masters.

Exploiting pacts with sinister supernatural forces, yuan-ti bargain away their humanity for the lethality and predatory deviousness of serpents. From hidden bastions, they manipulate rulers and the wealthy, seeking to control the world. Many yuan-ti possess venomous magic, which often manifests as fangs or striking serpents.

Yuan-ti have humanlike forms with a variety of horrifying serpentine transformations. Some have a scattering of reptilian scales, while others are giants that are more snake than human. Typically, the more snakelike yuan-ti are, the greater esteem they hold among their kind.

Yuan-ti might gain their reptilian features through dangerous supernatural rites. Roll on or choose a result from the Yuan-ti Transformations table to inspire how yuan-ti obtain their serpentine aspects.

Yuan-ti abominations have traded away nearly all evidence of their humanity, coming to resemble giant, upright serpents with scaly arms and hands. In battle, they relish opportunities to crush foes in their powerful coils or strike with their venomous fangs. These abominations can also shape-shift into snakes. In these forms, abominations are indistinguishable from normal serpents.

The true threat of yuan-ti abominations stems not from their physical might but from their cunning. These masterminds often lead cultlike cells of other yuan-ti and direct them in enacting elaborate conspiracies. Abominations avoid jeopardizing themselves, typically scheming from hidden bastions where they’re protected by yuan-ti and serpent guardians. These coldhearted leaders have a unique understanding of the supernatural forces that grant yuan-ti their powers, and they usually have insidious magical traps and contingencies at their disposal.

Great magic, twisted and corrupted... Malice beyond reckoning... Flesh reshaped, becoming serpentine horrors...
