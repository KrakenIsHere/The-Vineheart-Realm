It seems that I must do everything myself, since I have only fools for servants. Clearly disappointment must ever be the price of divinity.

—Iuz the Evil, cambion demigod

Cambions are former mortals corrupted by fiendish power or possessed by insidious forces. While tieflings are free-willed individuals with a hint of fiendish ancestry, cambions are inherently tied to or remade by the wicked magic of the Lower Planes.

Many cambions serve the malevolent forces that are the source of their powers. Others seek to claim the might of whatever created them or to seize otherworldly powers of their own. Among the most notorious of such cambions is Iuz, a villain who became an evil demigod and whose villainous nation threatens the Free City of Greyhawk on Oerth.

Cambions come into being in disparate ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Cambion Origins table to determine the source of a cambion’s fiendish might.

Catacomb-Scouring Necrophage

**Habitat:** Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** None

Ravenous corpse eaters, carrion crawlers gravitate toward places of slaughter and decay. In such charnel environs, they feast on the dead with no qualms about their meals’ origins or freshness.

Carrion crawlers have segmented bodies like gigantic cutworms. From beneath their multipart maws protrude eight thin, lashing tentacles. Creatures struck by these tentacles risk being paralyzed and consumed.

Carrion crawlers scour sewers, battlefields, necropolises, and fetid wildernesses for corpses, clinging to ceilings to ambush smaller prey and to avoid competing hunters. They’re drawn to light and the scent of blood, recognizing them as signs of food.

These scavengers avoid ingesting inorganic material. Crypts with funeral armors sucked clean of their corpses and eerily pristine catacombs are signs of infestation by carrion crawlers.

Devil of Pain and Control

**Habitat:** Planar (Nine Hells); **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables)

Also known as kytons, chain devils consider themselves morbid artisans who use deception, menace, and vicious metal to coerce prisoners into betraying themselves. Many serve powerful devils, wrenching secrets from imprisoned souls using deadly, animate chains. Left to their own devices, chain devils encourage ruthless individuals to pursue forbidden magic, leading their pupils down paths to the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells).

Along with psychological threats and physical harm, a chain devil uses its unnerving gaze to make its victims perceive their worst fear rather than the monster. Roll on or choose a result from the Chain Devil Masks table to inspire a chain devil’s fearful appearance.

Flying forth from the [Abyss](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Abyss), chasmes resemble horse-size flies.

Violent and unpredictable, chimeras combine the deadliest traits of lions, rams, and red dragons. With their fearsome claws, crushing horns, and fiery breath, chimeras are tempests of ferocity, driven by their three heads’ conflicting instincts. Their heads agree on little but their desires to feed and to drive competitors from the rugged territories where these monsters make their lairs. When they spot prey, chimeras typically strafe foes with their fire breath before landing to attack with their fangs, horns, and claws.

Owing to their draconic instincts, chimeras are greedy creatures that hoard treasures within cavernous lairs. They’re undiscerning about what they collect, gathering shiny objects alongside trophies and bones from their recent kills. Brave souls seeking to distract or temporarily appease a chimera can do so by offering it treasure and food.

Chuuls originated in forgotten ages when aboleths and stranger beings ruled alien empires beneath the waves. The aboleths transformed numerous deep-sea predators into servants that could venture beyond the seas to claim more magic and creatures to exploit. Chuuls are the most enduring of these bizarre servants.

Many chuuls serve [aboleth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194867-aboleth) overlords, carrying out their whims amid lightless seas and primeval swamps. Other chuuls obey new aberrant masters, such as [beholders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194923-beholder), [grells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195059-grell), or [mind flayers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer). Some chuuls follow their own drives, endlessly collecting ancient magic treasures or interpreting age-old orders to bizarre ends. Regardless of their agendas, chuuls snare creatures in their massive pincers before rendering foes helpless with their paralytic tentacles.

Chuuls don’t age and can lie dormant in hidden places for millennia before threats, ancient orders, or strange compulsions awaken them.

Guardian of Home and Heart

**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Clay golems are magical defenders made from earth and clay to protect places or communities. The materials used in creating clay golems originate from near the location the golems protect and often have special significance to their creators, such as clay from a holy site or bricks from a magical ruin. While some clay golems are masterfully sculpted to resemble living beings, others have only vaguely humanlike forms.

These golems obey their creators’ orders and protect what their makers value most. Some still follow these orders long after their creators’ deaths. Roll on or choose a result from the Clay Golem Orders table to inspire the commands a clay golem follows.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-c#Cloaker)Cloaker

Haunter in the Dark

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** [Implements](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ImplementsTables)

Cloakers are mysterious [Underdark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#UnderdarkThe) predators, named by adventurers for their resemblance to hanging cloaks when they cling to walls. What cloakers call themselves is unknown, if they refer to themselves at all. Though they’re undeniably intelligent, their behavior is often inscrutable.

Alex Stone[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/03-009.cloaker.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/03-009.cloaker.png)

Cloakers sometimes gather in Underdark enclaves, but they rarely build settlements or form social structures. Most operate as solitary predators, lurking in dismal subterranean reaches or abandoned dungeons—sometimes for months at a time—as they wait for prey to pass. They use their mottled hides to blend in with their surroundings. When unsuspecting prey nears, cloakers unfurl and attempt to latch on and then smother their victims in their powerful wings.

Cloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition to their methods of ambush, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal moans that non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable, primal ways. Cloakers might antagonize explorers lost in the Underdark for days, terrorizing and scattering them before attacking. They rarely converse with other beings, except to whisper eerie riddles to those they’re about to consume.

In addition, the cloaker halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes the same amount of damage.

The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of movement. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to try to detach the cloaker, doing so by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

Cloud giants use the power of the skies to observe and subtly influence the world. These giants resemble humans with hair ranging from silver to blue and with skin in cloudlike shades from stark white to twilight hues. Curved canines grow in their upper jaws, extending past their lower lips. In battle, they attack with weapons wreathed in storm clouds and throw roaring thunderheads.

Most cloud giants inhabit citadels crowning tremendous mountains or magical palaces that drift amid the clouds. Many of these giants believe they possess similarly lofty status or purpose. Some view themselves as godlike beings who can manipulate and steal from terrestrial beings with impunity. Others claim their long lives and place among the clouds grant them unique perspectives, so they chronicle what they witness in the world below without interfering. In either case, cloud giants often possess fabulous magical treasures, either claimed from across the world or created by (and gigantically sized for) themselves.

Titanic Vessel of Divine Might

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Colossi are massive Constructs created by the devout to reflect the nature of a deity, which could be benevolent or wicked. Colossi thrum with incredible magic and work divine will on the land.

Droves of faithful artisans craft a colossus in a shape to honor their deity, then call on that god to infuse the statue with life. This arduous process might take decades and involve hundreds of workers. If the god favors the creation, the mighty crystal at the construct’s heart pulses with divine power, and the colossus rises to protect the faithful or enact the god’s will.

Most colossi were created in ages past and now lie dormant in secluded wilderness, awakening only when disturbed or called on to serve once more.

Dragons of Curiosity and Community

**Habitat:** Hill; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world as a place of endless wonder and possibility. These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least, the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their deadly acid breath.

Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.

Guardian Manifestation of the Divine

**Habitat:** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Urban; **Treasure:** [Relics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#RelicsTables)

Viktor Titov[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/03-017.cuoatl.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/03-017.cuoatl.png)

Embodiments of prophecy and protectors of divine secrets, couatls ensure fate unfolds as it should. They resemble serpents with rainbow wings, and each is a manifestation of a divine edict, a truth or fate that a righteous god decrees must hold true for all time. Most couatls appear in places of ancient power, where they guard hidden magic or ensure foretold acts do or don’t come to pass. Rarely, couatls watch over communities or travel lands in disguise, interpreting omens or manipulating factors to set fate on its proper course.

Motivated by eternal mandates, couatls sometimes behave in inscrutable or antagonistic ways. They are inflexible and uncompromising, as their existences are fundamentally tied to their divine directives, but they harm other creatures only when absolutely necessary to achieve divine goals.

Each couatl goes through a period of renewal at the end of an age. In a couatl’s lifecycle, an age might correspond to a celestial calendar or some divine chronology. Near the age’s end, the couatl lays a wondrous, rainbow-hued egg. When the age ends, the couatl dies. For a period—perhaps a single day, perhaps until an annual solar event—the couatl’s work is unattended. Once this time passes, the same couatl that laid the egg hatches from it, fully grown and renewed to serve for another age.

Severed Appendages with Malicious Will

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** None

Crawling claws are severed hands that move and act of their own murderous accord. These deathless appendages can spring to life from the severed limbs of killers and villains, and sinister magic-users might animate crawling claws as foul servants. Crawling claws appear in a variety of forms, from decaying human hands to the fresh appendages of animals or monsters.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-c#CrawlingClaw)Crawling Claw

Lone crawling claws can continue killing sprees they perpetrated in life. Some recklessly attack the living, while others pursue specific victims. In rare cases, a crawling claw wreaks mayhem while the rest of its body still lives, with the original creature potentially unaware of its severed hand’s crimes.

Is it possible for any creature, any living being, to be inherently evil? Such an assertion may itself facilitate the committing of evil acts. By defining a person as evil, we give them free rein to behave as they will, absolving them from the wickedness of their words and the evil of their hands.

Cultists use magic and extreme measures to spread radical beliefs. Some privately pursue esoteric secrets, while others form shadowy cabals seeking to bring about terrifying ends. Cultists often follow obscure mystical traditions or obsess over interpretations of ancient prophecies. They might worship supernatural patrons—deities, otherworldly creatures, manipulative alien minds, or stranger forces.
