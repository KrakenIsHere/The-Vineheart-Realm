On the Elemental Plane of Earth, galaxies of gemstones twinkle over vaults of treasure. If dao are there, so is wealth worth hunting.

—Gundren Rockseeker, Dwarf Treasure Hunter

Genies of minerals and gemstones, dao embody the resolve of rock. Using innate magic, they move through the earth unimpeded, exploring depths inaccessible to most. Dao delight in the treasures of the earth, whether raw gemstones, jewelry crafted from pure metals, or wondrous fossils. In exchange for such treasures, dao might reveal underground mysteries, such as paths through the Underdark, buried ruins, or whole subterranean realms.

Many dao call the [Elemental Plane of Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofEarth) home. There, they create cities that glitter with treasure. Among these realms is the labyrinthine expanse called the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, which protects the City of Jewels, the Iron Crucible, and the Strait of Magnets.

Traits

**_Earth Glide._** The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn’t disturb the material it moves through.

**_Elemental Restoration._** If the dao dies outside the Elemental Plane of Earth, its body dissolves into dirt, and it gains a new body in 1d4 days, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere on the [Plane of Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#ElementalPlaneofEarth).

**_Magic Resistance._** The dao has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Wishes._** The dao has a 30 percent chance of knowing the [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) spell. If the dao knows it, the dao can cast it only on behalf of a non-genie creature who communicates a wish in a way the dao can understand.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-d#Darkmantle)Darkmantle

Ceiling-Clinging Ambush Predator

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Unnatural subterranean hunters, darkmantles veil themselves in magical shadows and use their bizarre anatomies to disguise themselves as stalactites. When prey passes below, lurking darkmantles drop and unfurl their webbed tentacles, attempting to blind, suffocate, or crush their victims.

Darkmantles share similarities with piercers and ropers and often hunt near those monsters. Scholars have attempted to establish a shared origin or life cycle between those creatures, but their efforts are thwarted by those monsters’ supernatural physiologies and deadly natures.

Just assume there’s no such thing as a stalactite.

Actions

**_Crush._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +5, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the darkmantle had Advantage on the attack roll, it covers the target, which has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition and is [suffocating](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SuffocationHazard) while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack only the target but has Advantage on its attack rolls. Its Speed becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its Speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can take an action to try to detach the darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.

**_Darkness Aura (1/Day)._** Magical [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) fills a 15-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from the darkmantle. This effect lasts while the darkmantle maintains [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on it, up to 10 minutes. [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) can’t penetrate this area, and no light can illuminate it.

...and his sorrows will stalk your land like hungry dogs until the seas turn to sand and the sun burns to cinders.

—Tablet fragment from the Bright Desert

Death dogs are plagues on the arid lands they inhabit. These vicious, two-headed canines ambush creatures they perceive as weaker than themselves, favoring the wounded or infirm. They attack recklessly, infecting as many creatures as possible with their diseased jaws. If driven off, death dogs linger close to their victims, letting infection weaken their prey before they attack again.

Legends tie death dogs to malicious death gods, the underworld, and cursed rulers. These stories are based on the malady death dogs spread. Roll on or choose a result from the Death Dog Malady Symptoms table to inspire symptoms spread by a death dog’s bite. These symptoms are cosmetic and don’t alter the effects of the death dog’s Bite action. The symptoms vanish when a creature no longer has the Poisoned condition from a death dog’s Bite.

A death knight and its aspirants march to war against the living

Champions of evil, death knights are armor-clad, skeletal warlords. Combining devastating martial prowess and blasphemous magic, these undying tyrants lead unholy legions against the living or brood in cursed citadels. Every death knight is haunted by a legacy of tragedy and dishonor that drives it to commit greater evils.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-d#DeathKnight)Death Knight

Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering commanders with grim histories. Some strive to end the curses that doom them to undeath, though their selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others, like the infamous death knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing themselves to action only when something reignites their deathless evil.

Beholder beyond Death

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** Any

Simon Dominic[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-005.death-tyrant.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-005.death-tyrant.png)

A death tyrant is a [beholder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194923-beholder) that pursues aberrant goals beyond its death. Ten magical singularities—all that remains of its magical eyes—orbit its floating, cyclopean skull, while the hateful gaze of its central eye socket stifles life and raises the dead.

Beholders typically transform into death tyrants over years when their dreams fixate on death, morbid apotheoses, or journeys to realms inhospitable to life. Some death tyrants rise from the corpses of slain beholders or result from exposure to strange magic or Underdark radiation. Sometimes beholders purposefully pursue this undead state, just as depraved magic-users pursue lichdom, although it is rare, as most beholders already believe themselves to be perfect beings.

No matter how death tyrants come into being, bizarre impulses drive their deathless existences. Their motivations tend to be extreme or beyond the reason of living creatures.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024/monsters-d#DeathTyrantLairs)Death Tyrant Lairs

Death tyrants often lurk deep in the Underdark, in the tunnel-mazes they occupied in life or in the lairs of enemy beholders they conquered. These lairs are devoid of life, as death tyrants change their servants into Undead horrors.

The region containing a death tyrant’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains Hit Points from a spell, it subtracts 1d10 from the number of Hit Points regained.

**Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they’re being watched. Any creature (excluding the death tyrant and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

If the death tyrant dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

A cluster of tiny lights descended from a dark crevice in the ceiling. These motes cast an eerie glow on the great, alien skull that hung beneath them.

After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
3. **Fear Ray.** _Wisdom Saving Throw:_ DC 17. _Failure:_ 10 (3d6) Psychic damage, and the target has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn. _Success:_ Half damage only.
4. **Slowing Ray.** _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 17. _Failure:_ 18 (4d8) Necrotic damage. Until the end of the target’s next turn, the target can’t take Reactions; its Speed is halved; and it can take either an action or a Bonus Action on its turn, not both. _Success:_ Half damage only.

10. **Death Ray.** _Dexterity Saving Throw:_ DC 17. _Failure:_ 55 (10d10) Necrotic damage. _Success:_ Half damage. _Failure or Success:_ The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 Hit Points.

What Lies beyond Lichdom

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

A demilich is a skull harboring the remnants of a lich’s wicked essence. If the burden of immortality overwhelms a lich, its consciousness turns inward as its body rots away. But if its remains are disturbed, a demilich rises. Demiliches usually appear as skulls adorned with gems or arcane sigils.

Demiliches jealously guard their deathtrap-laden sanctums. The most notorious of these is the Tomb of Horrors, lair of the infamous [Acererak](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Acererak).

The region containing a demilich’s lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Enervating Domain.** Whenever a creature other than the demilich or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest within 1 mile of the lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have its Hit Point maximum reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a Long Rest outside that area.

**Travel Ward.** Creatures can’t use teleportation or planar travel to enter or exit the lair.

If the demilich dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

**Habitat:** Planar (Upper Planes); **Treasure:** Relics

Devas are emissaries of divine will. These immortal messengers adopt the shapes of mystical beasts or idealized, winged mortals. As with all angels, their true forms are known only to the gods they serve.

Rather than literal correspondence from a god, a deva conveys an allegory or quest to mortals, tasking them with delivering something to its rightful place. While the angel might be called on in times of need, it encourages mortal heroism. Should a deva’s chosen champions carry out their charge, they experience a revelation or the world is changed in line with divine purpose.

Caio Monteiro[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-008.displacer-beasts.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-008.displacer-beasts.png)

A displacer beast resembles a gaunt, six-legged panther with a barbed tentacle sprouting from each of its shoulders. This predator uses innate magic to displace light so it appears to be several feet away from its actual location.

Displacer beasts hunt not just to feed but because they enjoy killing. Once displacer beasts begin stalking prey, they can’t be deterred until either they or their quarry is slain. While displacer beasts commonly inhabit dense forests, they might pursue travelers across great distances and even into cities or dungeons. More cunning than mere animals, these predators might set ambushes or lie hidden for days to bring down their prey.

Displacer beasts sometimes pursue prey through portals to other planes of existence. As a result, these predators can be found across the multiverse, particularly on the worlds of the [Material Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#MaterialPlane), in the [Shadowfell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Shadowfell), and in the [Feywild](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Feywild). These restless hunters can destroy a land’s natural balance and drive other creatures to extinction. As a result, many druid circles and Fey view displacer beasts as deadly threats.

Traits

**_Avoidance._** If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and half damage if it fails.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The displacer beast makes one Rend attack and one Tentacle attack.

If the djinni casts the spell for the creature, the djinni suffers none of the spell’s stress. Once the djinni has cast it three times, the djinni can’t do so again for 365 days.

Actions

**_Multiattack._** The djinni makes three attacks, using Storm Blade or Storm Bolt in any combination.

**_Storm Blade._** _Melee Attack Roll:_ +9, reach 5 feet. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) Slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) Lightning damage.

**_Storm Bolt._** _Ranged Attack Roll:_ +9, range 120 feet. _Hit:_ 13 (3d8) Thunder damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

**_Create Whirlwind._** The djinni conjures a whirlwind at a point it can see within 120 feet. The whirlwind fills a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-high [Cylinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) centered on that point.

The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 20 feet at the start of each of its turns.

Whenever the whirlwind enters a creature’s space or a creature enters the whirlwind, that creature is subjected to the following effect. _Strength Saving Throw:_ DC 17 (a creature makes this save only once per turn, and the djinni is unaffected). _Failure:_ While in the whirlwind, the target has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and moves with the whirlwind.

Draconic Tyrant Reborn

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Any

Slawomir Maniak[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-011.dracolich.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/04-011.dracolich.png)

The vilest dragons seek to escape the grip of death, employing ageless secrets and blasphemous magic to become horrors called dracoliches. These deathless dragons bind their spirits to gems and magically animate their rotting corpses. Eventually becoming skeletal horrors, dracoliches continue the centuries-spanning plots they pursued in life, seek revenge on those that brought them low, and strive toward vicious goals they couldn’t indulge in life.

Dracoliches combine the corrupt immortality of the undead with the legendary power of dragons. A dracolich retains a breath weapon, but it is a chilling necrotic blast. These terrors gradually sicken the land near their lairs and attract sinister followers—usually other undead or cultists seeking to revel in their terrible might. Living dragons of all types loathe and seek to destroy dracoliches, viewing them as distortions of draconic magic.

There are untold profane routes by which a dragon might become a dracolich. However one is created, a dracolich chooses a gem that becomes the anchor for its spirit and binds the deathless dragon to the world. So long as a dracolich is on the same plane of existence as its soul gem, the dracolich can survive the destruction of its physical body. Its spirit retreats into the gem if the dracolich’s body is destroyed, and the monster might one day regain its terrifying form. Dracoliches often sequester their soul gems within meaningful treasure from their hoard or in unassuming baubles. Roll on or choose a result from the Dracolich Soul Gem Vessels table to inspire what holds a dracolich’s soul gem.

A dracolich lurks in a corrupted version of the lair it had in life. The region containing a dracolich’s lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

**Sapping Mist.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level.

**Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have Disadvantage on Death Saving Throws.

If the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul Gem trait).

Dragon turtles are mighty creatures with shells large enough to be mistaken for islands and jaws capable of snapping ships like twigs. While some of these aquatic dragons contentedly slumber in the depths, others jealously guard vast territories with their scalding breath and lay claim to anything that sinks into the depths or sails on the waves. Occasionally these dragons agree to aid pirates, aquatic peoples, or oceanic religions in return for contributions to their sunken treasure hoards.

Many dragon turtles live in secluded lairs or ruins deep underwater, and they might not be spotted by surface dwellers for generations. Like both their namesakes, dragon turtles can have exceptionally long lives. Some recall the wonders of ages past or remarkable individuals that passed through their realms long ago. Such dragon turtles might be convinced to share their tales or provide guidance through their territories in exchange for treasures they’ve never glimpsed on the ocean floor.

Tree-Bound Guardian of Nature

**Habitat:** Forest; **Treasure:** Any

Guardians of the woodlands, dryads magically flit from tree to tree and from root to bough, harrying trespassers with tangling vines and thorns. Most of these elusive beings have a special connection with one plant or a natural sanctuary that they protect. Some also share physical similarities with the plants they’re most connected to. Dryads might sicken or die if their plant or sanctuary is destroyed, recovering only if it is healed or magically replaced. Roll on or choose an option from the Dryad Sanctuaries table to inspire a dryad’s bond.
