## Ice Devil

Devil of Antipathy and Intellectual Arrogance

**Habitat:** Planar (Nine Hells); **Treasure:** [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables)

Heartless strategists of the Nine Hells, ice devils—also known as gelugons—forsake emotion to indulge in their own malicious interpretations of logic. For them, the multiverse is a puzzle that must be solved to benefit them, their masters, and the Nine Hells.

Ice devils act maliciously, disguising their whims as reason and strategy. In the service of evil masters, these insectile devils patiently plot the movements of infernal armies and scheme ways to fulfill wicked goals. They might also serve as guardians, owing to their martial prowess and ability to reshape battlefields with walls of ice.

When indulging their own schemes, ice devils tempt mortals to forsake empathy and social connections to embrace selfish, destructive visions of intellectualism. After isolating victims, these devils drain them of their secrets or send them forth to spread fractious dogmas cloaked as reason.

Ice devils usually lurk in frozen realms, particularly the frigid layer of [Cania](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Cania) in the [Nine Hells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#NineHells).

Part of the charm of ice devils is that they always think they’re smarter than you. Mmm—there are few pleasures sweeter than proving a devil wrong.

Devil of Pettiness and Suspicion

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** None

Patrik Hell[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/09-002.imp.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/mm/hAxSwXnO1TSUruhZ/09-002.imp.png)

Known for their cowardice and toadying, imps serve devils and wicked magic-users. Their abilities to shape-shift and pass unseen make them skillful spies and adept at fleeing danger. Imps sent to surveil other creatures relate what they discover to their masters, but they frequently omit important details or cast events in the worst possible light to mislead their masters into following the imps’ devilish council.

Imps without masters delight in manipulating other creatures and inflating their own egos. They might take over bands of weaker monsters, or they might pose as helpful spirits and trick influential individuals into pursuing nefarious ends.

I can tell you what I know, but wouldn’t you rather I tell you what’ll let you do what you know you’re going to do anyway?

—Skeever, imp servant of Firan Zal’honan

Incubi exploit the vulnerability of mortal dreams. Slipping into the homes of sleepers, incubi feed off dreams and replace them with terrifying nightmares. Incubi visit victims nightly until their prey expires. The incubi then hunt for new victims, preferring the loved ones of past targets.

Incubi can transform into succubi and vice versa, taking the forms they need to manipulate foes in dreams or in the flesh.

Those visited by an incubus have recurring nightmares. Roll on or choose a result from the Incubus Nightmares table to inspire these night terrors.

Brain-Eating Body Thief

**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Intellect devourers serve their [mind flayer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195125-mind-flayer) creators by consuming other creatures’ brains and puppetizing the mindless bodies. These quadrupedal brains seek to ambush sapient beings, then drain their thoughts until they’re mindless. Then, if their victims are Humanoids, they enter the creatures’ skulls. With access to the victims’ knowledge and control of their bodies, intellect devourers use their perfect disguises to pass as the people they’ve replaced and further mind flayer plots.

The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; its understanding of Deep Speech; its telepathy; and its Detect Intelligence trait. It otherwise adopts the target’s game statistics. It knows everything the target knew, including spells and languages.

If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) spell. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies unless its brain is restored before the end of the intellect devourer’s next turn.

Unseen Magical Assassin

**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** None

Magic and malice give form to invisible stalkers, bodiless spirits of the air. These elusive beings pass unseen with nothing more than a stirring of air. They control powerful winds capable of moving objects and battering foes. Magic-users conjure these creatures to serve as killers and thieves. Invisible stalkers relentlessly pursue their quarry, and they rarely leave evidence of their crimes.
