Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1Rage)Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

**_Damage Resistance._** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**_Rage Damage._** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike)—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**_Strength Advantage._** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**_No Concentration or Spells._** You can’t maintain [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), and you can’t cast spells.

**_Duration._** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level9BrutalStrike)Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage). If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**_Forceful Blow._** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

**_Hamstring Blow._** The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

**_Staggering Blow._** The target has [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of your next turn.

**_Sundering Blow._** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level15PersistentRage)Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended uses of Rage.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition (not just the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition) or don Heavy armor.

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1BardicInspiration)Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**_Using Bardic Inspiration._** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

**_Number of Uses._** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_At Higher Levels._** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1BardSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the [Bard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [Dancing Lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) and [Vicious Mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619216-vicious-mockery) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Bard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Color Spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618978-color-spray), [Dissonant Whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), and [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619143-healing-word) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Bard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a **[Musical Instrument](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MusicalInstrumentVaries)** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2Expertise)Level 2: Expertise

You gain [Expertise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) (see the [rules glossary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/rules-glossary#Expertise)) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2JackofAllTrades)Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

A Bard’s Repertoire

Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks?

When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all?

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3BardSubclass)Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The [College of Dance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofValor) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level4BardAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

A Bard shapes inspiration and imagination into magic

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level5FontofInspiration)Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level7Countercharm)Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level10MagicalSecrets)Level 10: Magical Secrets

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the [Bard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardSpellList), [Cleric](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList), [Druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList), and [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level18SuperiorInspiration)Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level19BardEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level20WordsofCreation)Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the [Power Word Heal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618880-power-word-heal) and [Power Word Kill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618886-power-word-kill) spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardSpellList)Bard Spell List

This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to preserve their traditions. This section presents the [College of Dance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofDance), [College of Glamour](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofGlamour), [College of Lore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofLore), and [College of Valor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofValor) subclasses.

College of Dance Subclass

_Move in Harmony with the Cosmos_

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can’t be contained within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes agility, speed, and grace.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3DazzlingFootwork)Level 3: Dazzling Footwork

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits.

**_Dance Virtuoso._** You have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any Charisma ([Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check you make that involves you dancing.

**_Unarmored Defense._** Your base [Armor Class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

**_Agile Strikes._** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.

**_Bardic Damage._** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike). When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike’s normal damage. This roll doesn’t expend the die.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6InspiringMovement)Level 6: Inspiring Movement

When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.

None of this feature’s movement provokes [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6TandemFootwork)Level 6: Tandem Footwork

When you roll [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don’t have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to Initiative equal to the number rolled.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level14LeadingEvasion)Level 14: Leading Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CollegeofGlamour)College of Glamour

_Weave Beguiling Fey Magic_

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

College of Glamour Subclass

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3BeguilingMagic)Level 3: Beguiling Magic

You always have the [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Mirror Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619060-mirror-image) spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3MantleofInspiration)Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration

You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6MantleofMajesty)Level 6: Mantle of Majesty

You always have the [Command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618985-command) spell prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you cast _Command_ without expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) ends. During this time, you can cast _Command_ as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.

Any creature [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you automatically fails its saving throw against the _Command_ you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action required).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level14UnbreakableMajesty)Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty

As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

College of Lore Subclass

_Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge_

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3BonusProficiencies)Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3CuttingWords)Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6MagicalDiscoveries)Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the [Cleric](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList), [Druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList), or [Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) spell list or any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Bard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BardFeatures).

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level14PeerlessSkill)Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.

College of Valor Subclass

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3CombatInspiration)Level 3: Combat Inspiration

You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.

**_Defense._** When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

**_Offense._** Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack’s damage against the target.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3MartialTraining)Level 3: Martial Training

You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6ExtraAttack)Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

**_Cantrips._** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance), [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame), and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619174-thaumaturgy) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Cleric Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. [Bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618933-bless), [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), and [Shield of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Cleric Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1DivineOrder)Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Protector._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

**_Thaumaturge._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Cleric spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2ClericChannelDivinity)Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the [Cleric Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericFeatures).

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Spark._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

**_Turn Undead._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3ClericSubclass)Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The [Life Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#WarDomain) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level4ClericAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level5SearUndead)Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level7BlessedStrikes)Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

**_Divine Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level10DivineIntervention)Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

A Cleric prays for the day’s spells

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level14ImprovedBlessedStrikes)Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

**_Divine Strike._** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level19ClericEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level20GreaterDivineIntervention)Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 [Long Rests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList)Cleric Spell List

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the [Life Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#LifeDomain), [Light Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#LightDomain), [Trickery Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#TrickeryDomain), and [War Domain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#WarDomain) subclasses.

_Soothe the Hurts of the World_

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.

**_Cast Spells._** You can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses.

**_Distract._** When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.

Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.

Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1DruidSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the [Druid spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. [Druidcraft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619158-druidcraft) and [Produce Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618901-produce-flame) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**_Spell Slots._** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618847-animal-friendship), [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Faerie Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), and [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Druidic Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1Druidic)Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1PrimalOrder)Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Magician._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Druid spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**_Warden._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2WildShape)Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**_Number of Uses._** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the [Druid Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#DruidFeatures).

**_Known Forms._** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see [appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks/) for stat block options). The [Rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775836-rat), [Riding Horse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775839-riding-horse), [Spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775844-spider), and [Wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775850-wolf) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the _Monster Manual_ or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#BeastShapes)Beast Shapes
|Druid Level|Known Forms|Max CR|Fly Speed|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|4|1/4|No|
|4|6|1/2|No|
|8|8|1|Yes|

**_Rules While Shape-Shifted._** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Druid level.

**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**No Spellcasting.** You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.

**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2WildCompanion)Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3DruidSubclass)Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The [Circle of the Land](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheStars) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level4DruidAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level5WildResurgence)Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level7ElementalFury)Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.

**_Primal Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level15ImprovedElementalFury)Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.

**_Primal Strike._** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level18BeastSpells)Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level19DruidEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level20Archdruid)Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**_Evergreen Wild Shape._** Whenever you roll [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

**_Nature Magician._** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Longevity._** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

This section presents the Druid spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they call circles. This section presents the [Circle of the Land](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheLand), [Circle of the Moon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheMoon), [Circle of the Sea](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheSea), and [Circle of the Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#CircleoftheStars) subclasses.

_Celebrate Connection to the Natural World_

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6NaturalRecovery)Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

They last there for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or die. You and your allies have [Half Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.

_Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds_

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3CircleForms)Level 3: Circle Forms

_Become One with Tides and Storms_

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature’s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

When you manifest the Emanation and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

Instead of manifesting the [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all the benefits of the Emanation and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3StarMap)Level 3: Star Map

You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) spells prepared, and you can cast _Guiding Bolt_ without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous map.

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

**_Archer._** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

**_Chalice._** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.

**_Dragon._** A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level6CosmicOmen)Level 6: Cosmic Omen

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**_Weal (Even)._** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**_Woe (Odd)._** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level10TwinklingConstellations)Level 10: Twinkling Constellations

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level14FullofStars)Level 14: Full of Stars

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3Spellcasting)Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) (see that class’s section for its list). [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) and [Shocking Grasp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots.** The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the [Wizard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList). [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618946-burning-hands), [Jump](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618991-jump), and [Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619019-shield) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3WarBond)Level 3: War Bond

You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest). The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to which someone else is attuned.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a Bonus Action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level7WarMagic)Level 7: War Magic

When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level10EldritchStrike)Level 10: Eldritch Strike

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level15ArcaneCharge)Level 15: Arcane Charge

_Augment Physical Might with Psionic Power_

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3PsionicPower)Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior Energy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.

|Fighter Level|Die Size|Number|

|5|D8|6|
|9|D8|8|
|11|D10|8|
|13|D10|10|
|17|D12|12|

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Protective Field._** When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.

**_Psionic Strike._** You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of yourself with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, rolling it and dealing Force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

**_Telekinetic Movement._** You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself; the target must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or from your hand.

Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level7TelekineticAdept)Level 7: Telekinetic Adept

You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.

**_Psi-Powered Leap._** As a Bonus Action, you gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this Bonus Action, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**_Telekinetic Thrust._** When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Intelligence modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you can give the target the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition or transport it up to 10 feet horizontally.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level10GuardedMind)Level 10: Guarded Mind

You have Resistance to Psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn with the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) and end every effect on yourself giving you those conditions.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level15BulwarkofForce)Level 15: Bulwark of Force

You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a Bonus Action, you can choose creatures, including yourself, within 30 feet of yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures has [Half Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level18TelekineticMaster)Level 18: Telekinetic Master

You always have the [Telekinesis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619157-telekinesis) spell prepared.

On each of your turns while you maintain [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1MartialArts)Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons, which are the following:

- Simple Melee weapons
- Martial Melee weapons that have the [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light) property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

**_Bonus Unarmed Strike._** You can make an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Martial Arts Die._** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

**_Dexterous Attacks._** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level1MonkUnarmoredDefense)Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base [Armor Class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level2MonksFocus)Level 2: Monk’s Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Monk Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#MonkFeatures).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**_Flurry of Blows._** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two [Unarmed Strikes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Patient Defense._** You can take the [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) actions as a Bonus Action.

**_Step of the Wind._** You can take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the [Monk Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#MonkFeatures).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3DeflectAttacks)Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#Level3MonkSubclass)Level 3: Monk Subclass

At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.

**_Reach._** When you make an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

**_Elemental Strikes._** Whenever you hit with your [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.

Choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

Each creature in the Sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

**_Destructive Stride._** When you use your Step of the Wind, your Speed increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn. For that duration, any creature of your choice takes damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you enter a space within 5 feet of it. The damage type is your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**_Empowered Strikes._** Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you hit it with an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike).

When you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1LayOnHands)Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1PaladinSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [Paladin spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PaladinSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Spell Slots._** The [Paladin Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PaladinFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. [Heroism](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619151-heroism) and [Searing Smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619009-searing-smite) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Paladin Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PaladinFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1PaladinWeaponMastery)Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2PaladinFightingStyle)Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FightingStyleFeats) for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**_Blessed Warrior._** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a [list of Cleric spells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes#ClericSpellList)). [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2PaladinsSmite)Level 2: Paladin’s Smite

You always have the [Divine Smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618833-divine-smite) spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3ChannelDivinity)Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Sense._** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619138-hallow) spell.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3PaladinSubclass)Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The [Oath of Devotion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofVengeance) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

Breaking Your Oath

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.

A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.

If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level4PaladinAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level5PaladinExtraAttack)Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level5FaithfulSteed)Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the [Find Steed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618879-find-steed) spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6AuraofProtection)Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level9AbjureFoes)Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10AuraofCourage)Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level11RadiantStrikes)Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14RestoringTouch)Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [Paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition). You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18AuraExpansion)Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level19PaladinEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofsenseTruesightsense) is recommended.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PaladinSpellList)Paladin Spell List

This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires Concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PaladinSubclasses)Paladin Subclasses

A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Oath of Devotion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofDevotion), [Oath of Glory](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofGlory), [Oath of the Ancients](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathoftheAncients), and [Oath of Vengeance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofVengeance) subclasses.

Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#OathofDevotion)Oath of Devotion

_Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order_

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Let your word be your promise.
- Protect the weak and never fear to act.
- Let your honorable deeds be an example.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3OathofDevotionSpells)Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3SacredWeapon)Level 3: Sacred Weapon

When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the weapon.

_Preserve Life and Light in the World_

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves. Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Shelter life.

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts.

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Ranger Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#RangerFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3PrimalCompanion)Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: **[Beast of the Land](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#BeastoftheLand)**, **[Beast of the Sea](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#BeastoftheSea)**, or **[Beast of the Sky](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#BeastoftheSky)**. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is [Friendly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.

**_The Beast in Combat._** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike action. If you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the Dodge action.

**_Restoring or Replacing the Beast._** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level5CunningStrike)Level 5: Cunning Strike

You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**_Poison (Cost: 1d6)._** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

To use this effect, you must have a [Poisoner’s Kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/492-poisoners-kit) on your person.

**_Trip (Cost: 1d6)._** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

**_Withdraw (Cost: 1d6)._** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

**_Daze (Cost: 2d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.

**_Knock Out (Cost: 6d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**_Obscure (Cost: 3d6)._** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn.

_Enhance Stealth with Arcane Spells_

Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with spells, learning magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3ArcaneTricksterSpellcasting)Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.

**_Cantrips._** You know three cantrips: [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand) and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSpellList) (see that class’s section for its list). [Mind Sliver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619037-mind-sliver) and [Minor Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand), with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**_Spell Slots._** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619102-disguise-self), and [Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

You gain the ability to distract targets with your [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand). When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level17SpellThief)Level 17: Spell Thief

You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can’t cast it until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

_Practice the Grim Art of Death_

An Assassin’s training focuses on using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency.

_Strike Foes with Psionic Blades_

A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3PsionicPower)Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass.

Soulknife Subclass

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all of them when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Psi-Bolstered Knack._** If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.

**_Psychic Whispers._** You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).

The first time you use this power after each [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you don’t expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3PsychicBlades)Level 3: Psychic Blades

You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action or make an [Opportunity Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack), you can manifest a Psychic Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:

**Weapon Category:** Simple Melee

**Damage on a Hit:** 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll

**Properties:** [Finesse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse), [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) (range 60/120 feet)

**Mastery:** [Vex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Vex) (you can use this property, and it doesn’t count against the number of properties you can use with [Weapon Mastery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#MasteryProperties))

The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level9SoulBlades)Level 9: Soul Blades

You can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.

**_Homing Strikes._** If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

**_Psychic Teleportation._** As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level13PsychicVeil)Level 13: Psychic Veil

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you gain the [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level17RendMind)Level 17: Rend Mind

You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the [Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.

If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1SorcererSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the [Sorcerer spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#SorcererSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light), [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618893-prestidigitation), [Shocking Grasp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp), and [Sorcerous Burst](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618839-sorcerous-burst) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Sorcerer Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#SorcererFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618946-burning-hands) and [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Sorcerer Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#SorcererFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1InnateSorcery)Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2FontofMagic)Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the [Sorcerer Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#SorcererFeatures). You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

**_Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points._** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).

**_Creating Spell Slots._** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2Metamagic)Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “[Metamagic Options](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#MetamagicOptions)” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3SorcererSubclass)Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The [Aberrant Sorcery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#AberrantSorcery), [Clockwork Sorcery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#ClockworkSorcery), [Draconic Sorcery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#DraconicSorcery), and [Wild Magic Sorcery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WildMagicSorcery) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level4SorcererAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level5SorcerousRestoration)Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level7SorceryIncarnate)Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your [Metamagic options](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#MetamagicOptions) on each spell you cast.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level19SorcererEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level20ArcaneApotheosis)Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

_Wield Unnatural Psionic Power_

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.

Aberrant Sorcery Subclass

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3TelepathicSpeech)Level 3: Telepathic Speech

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6PsionicSorcery)Level 6: Psionic Sorcery

When you cast any level 1+ spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic components, and it requires no Material components unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6PsychicDefenses)Level 6: Psychic Defenses

You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws to avoid or end the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14RevelationinFlesh)Level 14: Revelation in Flesh

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.

**_Aquatic Adaptation._** You gain a Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.

**_Glistening Flight._** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.

**_See the Invisible._** You can see any [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover). Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.

**_Wormlike Movement._** Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18WarpingImplosion)Level 18: Warping Implosion

You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

_Channel Cosmic Forces of Order_

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it’s part of a vast and glorious system.

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) or [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage), you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6BastionofLaw)Level 6: Bastion of Law

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) or until you use this feature again.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14TranceofOrder)Level 14: Trance of Order

You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage), and whenever you make a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18ClockworkCavalcade)Level 18: Clockwork Cavalcade

You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot [Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

**_Heal._** The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.

**_Repair._** Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.

**_Dispel._** Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

_Breathe the Magic of Dragons_

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3DraconicSpells)Level 3: Draconic Spells

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6ElementalAffinity)Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14DragonWings)Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18DragonCompanion)Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast [Summon Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

_Unleash Chaotic Magic_

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3WildMagicSurge)Level 3: Wild Magic Surge

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WildMagicSurge) to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3TidesofChaos)Level 3: Tides of Chaos

You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) before you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can use this feature again.

If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a Long Rest, you automatically roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WildMagicSurge).

You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14ControlledChaos)Level 14: Controlled Chaos

You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WildMagicSurge), you can roll twice and use either number.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18TamedSurge)Level 18: Tamed Surge

Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1EldritchInvocations)Level 1: Eldritch Invocations

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as [Pact of the Tome](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#PactoftheTome). Invocations are described in the “[Eldritch Invocation Options](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#EldritchInvocationOptions)” section later in this class’s description.

**_Prerequisites._** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**_Replacing and Gaining Invocations._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the [Warlock Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WarlockFeatures).

You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1PactMagic)Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the [Warlock spell list](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WarlockSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. [Eldritch Blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) and [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618893-prestidigitation) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Warlock Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WarlockFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell [Witch Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619215-witch-bolt), you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Hex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618988-hex) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Warlock Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WarlockFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2MagicalCunning)Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3WarlockSubclass)Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The [Archfey Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level4WarlockAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level9ContactPatron)Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the [Contact Other Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619052-contact-other-plane) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level11MysticArcanum)Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the [Warlock Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WarlockFeatures), you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

This section presents the [Archfey Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#ArchfeyPatron), [Celestial Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#CelestialPatron), [Fiend Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#FiendPatron), and [Great Old One Patron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#GreatOldOnePatron) subclasses.

_Bargain with Whimsical Fey_

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

**_Refreshing Step._** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints).

**_Taunting Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

**_Dreadful Step._** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10BeguilingDefenses)Level 10: Beguiling Defenses

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

As a Bonus Action, you can heal yourself or one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, expending dice from the pool.

Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of the creature takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of the current turn.

_Make a Deal with the Lower Planes_

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

_Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings_

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3AwakenedMind)Level 3: Awakened Mind

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1WizardSpellcasting)Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light), [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand), and [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Wizard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardFeatures).

**_Spellbook._** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify). You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618874-feather-fall), [Mage Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619006-mage-armor), [Magic Missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619022-magic-missile), [Sleep](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619064-sleep), and [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Wizard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardFeatures). The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**_Spell Slots._** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Wizard Features table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) or your [spellbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/86-spellbook) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a [Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.

**_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.

**_Copying the Book._** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1RitualAdept)Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level1ArcaneRecovery)Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level2Scholar)Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). You have [Expertise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in the chosen skill.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3WizardSubclass)Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The [Abjurer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Abjurer), [Diviner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Diviner), [Evoker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Evoker), and [Illusionist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Illusionist) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level4WizardAbilityScoreImprovement)Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level18SpellMastery)Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level19WizardEpicBoon)Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#WizardSubclasses)Wizard Subclasses

A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Abjurer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Abjurer), [Diviner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Diviner), [Evoker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Evoker), and [Illusionist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Illusionist) subclasses.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Abjurer)Abjurer

_Shield Companions and Banish Foes_

Your study of magic is focused on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide against a variety of hostile magic and other attacks.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3AbjurationSavant)Level 3: Abjuration Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3ArcaneWard)Level 3: Arcane Ward

You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). The ward has a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 Hit Points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains.

Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alternatively, as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

Abjurer Subclass

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6ProjectedWard)Level 6: Projected Ward

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage, you can take a Reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. If that creature has any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10SpellBreaker)Level 10: Spell Breaker

You always have the [Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell) and [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spells prepared. In addition, you can cast _Dispel Magic_ as a Bonus Action, and you can add your Proficiency Bonus to its ability check.

When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14SpellResistance)Level 14: Spell Resistance

You have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of spells.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Diviner)Diviner

_Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse_

The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

Diviner Subclass

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3DivinationSavant)Level 3: Divination Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3Portent)Level 3: Portent

Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6ExpertDivination)Level 6: Expert Divination

Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2+ spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can’t be higher than level 5.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10TheThirdEye)Level 10: The Third Eye

You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**_Darkvision._** You gain [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 120 feet.

**_Greater Comprehension._** You can read any language.

**_See Invisibility._** You can cast [See Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619011-see-invisibility) without expending a spell slot.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14GreaterPortent)Level 14: Greater Portent

The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature rather than two.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Evoker)Evoker

CAROLINE GARIBA[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-040.evoker.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-040.evoker.png)

Evoker Subclass

_Create Explosive Elemental Effects_

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3EvocationSavant)Level 3: Evocation Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3PotentCantrip)Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6SculptSpells)Level 6: Sculpt Spells

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10EmpoweredEvocation)Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14Overchannel)Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Illusionist)Illusionist

_Weave Subtle Spells of Deception_

You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.

POLAR ENGINE[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-041.illusionist.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/MKDHZ1nxSXDDLOw2/04-041.illusionist.png)

Illusionist Subclass

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3IllusionSavant)Level 3: Illusion Savant

Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level3ImprovedIllusions)Level 3: Improved Illusions

You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components, and if an Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.

You also know the [Minor Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619039-minor-illusion) cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of _Minor Illusion_, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level6PhantasmalCreatures)Level 6: Phantasmal Creatures

You always have the [Summon Beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619106-summon-beast) and [Summon Fey](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619115-summon-fey) spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to Illusion, which causes the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast the spell in that way again.

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level10IllusorySelf)Level 10: Illusory Self

When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).

##### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-classes-continued#Level14IllusoryReality)Level 14: Illusory Reality

You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can’t deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.
