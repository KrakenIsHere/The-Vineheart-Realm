### Rest Conditions:
If a rest passes into a new day a status of “Well Rested” may apply based on a counter roll with a **1d10** by the player for the DM’s roll of a **1d12**
> [!Warning] Sleep amount
> Too little or too much sleep can result in the “Poorly Rested” status

#### Keeping watch:
During a Long Rest, party members can “keep watch” The members keeping said watch will only get a partial long rest. In the event of an interrupted rest, the members keeping watch will not have the status “surprised” applied, and will be ready for potential combat.

A rotation can be applied, resulting in all members only getting a partial long rest while passing the full 8 hours

#### Catchup:
An individual short rest can be taken during travel, provided conditions allow.
